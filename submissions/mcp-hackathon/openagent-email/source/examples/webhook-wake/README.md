# Webhook-wake receiver

Optional standalone HTTP receiver for OpenAgentEmail outbound webhooks. It
verifies `X-OAE-Signature` on bounded raw bytes, maps a static route to one
mailbox and one Orca terminal, and may send a **fixed neutral** new-mail
notice. It does not consume mail, does not interpret subject/body/from/URLs,
and does not talk to the production API process.

This example is not enabled by compose, CI, or any live subscription. Default
mode is **observe** (validate and log `would_wake` only). **Canary** sends only
to an explicitly configured test seat. Do not retire mail sentinels from this
tree.

## Contract

- HMAC-SHA256 over UTF-8(`timestamp + "."`) followed by the **original raw
  body bytes** (no UTF-8 decode/re-encode of the body) using the displayed
  `whs_…` secret (UTF-8, prefix included). Rotation: any bounded `v1`
  candidate may match the current or previous secret. Timestamp must be an
  integer unix second within ±300s. JSON/UTF-8 is interpreted only after
  the signature check. RFC-0001 §5.1 / §6.1 requires a `data` object on
  every event (`docs/rfcs/0001-outbound-webhooks.md` lines 672 and 775;
  `formatPingPayload` always supplies one). `data: null`, a missing `data`,
  or a non-object is `invalid_data` (400). `mail.received` also requires
  `data.object === "mail"` and `webhook.ping` requires
  `data.object === "webhook"` (local producer `formatMailPayload` /
  `formatPingPayload`). Missing or mismatched `data.object` is
  `invalid_data_object` (400) and never wakes. Mail without an address is never
  a 2xx success.
- Events: metadata `mail.received` and authenticated `webhook.ping`. Ping
  never wakes. A ping must also match the configured `subscriptionId`
  (`data.webhookId`) and domain before `ping_ok`; a wrong or missing
  binding is `400 ping_binding_mismatch` and is not a successful
  verification. Other types are ignored with an explicit disposition.
- 2xx only after a confirmed Orca **transport submission** (or a durable
  observe record) **and** a durable dedup write. Transient send/storage/
  timeout/authenticated mapping mismatch failures return 503 so the sender
  can retry. Dedup key is `subscriptionId + signed event id`, retained 7
  days (≥72h plus a 1h delivery margin). Concurrent duplicates share one in-flight operation.
  **Observe replay:** an `observed` record for the same subscription+event
  id suppresses a later canary send of that id. Switching to canary
  requires a **new** event id (or a new test send). This is not a live
  catch-up/replay feature.
- Semantics are **at-least-once**. A crash after `orca terminal send` exits 0
  and before the dedup commit can duplicate the neutral wake. A zero send
  exit is **submitted**, never **consumed**.
- Request path cannot choose a terminal or command. Argv is fixed:
  `orca terminal send --terminal <bound> --enter --text <neutral>` with
  `shell=false`, timeout+SIGKILL of the **spawned job process group**,
  and output caps. No `--interrupt`. Ambient bun/node is never signalled.
  Shipped `webhook-wake.service` / `webhook-wake.user.service` omit
  `KillMode=`, so systemd default `KillMode=control-group` applies:
  stopping the unit signals every process in the service cgroup,
  including a `detached` orca child. Bare/manual `bun src/main.ts` has
  no cgroup — a parent SIGKILL can leave that detached child running.
  The in-process kill path only signals `pid > 1 && pid !== self` of the
  spawned job group; that is a PID-reuse footgun guard, not a substitute
  for cgroup teardown. This example does not add a PDEATHSIG wrapper;
  prefer the unit (or an equivalent cgroup) in deployment.
- The child inherits a runtime allowlist (`HOME`, `USER`, `XDG_*`, `PATH`)
  so a colocated Orca install can resolve its files. API credentials and
  secrets are not forwarded. Placeholder operator identity is **ops** in
  the system unit, `runtime.env.example`, and `config.user.example.json`.
  The **system** unit must not use `%h`/`%U` (those are the service
  manager, typically `/root` and UID 0). Put `HOME` / `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` in
  `/etc/webhook-wake/runtime.env`. The optional **user** unit may use
  `%h`/`%U` and writes durable state under `%h/.local/state/webhook-wake`
  (`StateDirectory=webhook-wake`). `ProtectHome=read-only`.
  Both units use `ExecStart=/usr/bin/bun` as a **placeholder**. Before
  enabling either unit, replace that path with the absolute Bun executable
  the service user can run (`command -v bun` as `ops` or the user
  instance). The binary must be readable and executable by that user.
  This tree does not create `/usr/bin/bun` or any host symlink.
- `GET /health` is liveness only and is the public monitor target.
  `GET /ready` lists `routeKey` / `subscriptionId` and stays **private**.
  Unauthenticated readiness is **intentional**. The private-deployment
  prerequisite is loopback listen and/or a reverse proxy that excludes
  public `/ready` (Caddy/nginx templates already omit it). This example
  does not add `/ready` authentication.
  **Readiness IO:** path-depth walks are ancestor chains only (no
  recursive tree scan). `inspectDedupFile` reads and parses the **entire**
  dedup file then scans all records — cost is bounded by **on-disk file
  size**, not by `dedup.maxRecords` (a formerly-large or corrupt file still
  costs proportional to bytes on `/ready`; `maxRecords` only gates the
  live-capacity ready bit after the full scan). Identifiers on `/ready`
  are deployment-private by the loopback/proxy prerequisite above, not
  by adding auth. **No TTL cache:** readiness must reflect the current
  sticky-dir / `.dirsync` / mapping truth before the next wake; a stale
  cached `ready: true` would re-introduce the wake-then-503 inversion
  this hardening closes, so this example deliberately does not cache.
  (Hardening tracked as https://github.com/openagentemail/openagentemail/issues/177.)
  Caddy/nginx templates proxy `/health` and `/hooks/*` only. Binding a
  non-loopback listen address requires explicit
  `listen.allowNonLoopback: true` at load time (`config_invalid:listen.allowNonLoopback`
  otherwise); loopback remains the default.
  Unknown hook routes return **404**; a known route with a failed
  signature returns **401**. Route keys are not credentials; the
  distinction is intentional and is not an authentication system.
  If a route key later gains authorization weight, revisit this split.
-   Dedup fsyncs the file and the parent directory after rename, including
  first directory creation. The commit temp file is created exclusively
  (`O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`) with a short independent prefix (`ww.<hex>`)
  in the same parent so a 240-byte dest basename still fits Linux NAME_MAX;
  write loops until the whole Buffer is on that descriptor or
  fails closed (zero-progress/short/error). This is not a complete
  shared-directory or TOCTOU defense. The `.unacked` marker is written and fsynced
  (file + parent directory) **before** rename so a crash after a failed
  parent fsync still recovers the durable-intent signal. A non-regular
  `.unacked` (FIFO/dir) is rejected before any synchronous write, including
  the `dir_fsync` recovery rewrite. 2xx is withheld
  until that parent fsync succeeds. A failed **mkdir**
  fsync records the ancestor chain in `.dirsync` and resyncs that chain
  on retry/restart before ACK. A required ancestor fsync failure
  (including `EACCES`/`EPERM`) fails closed — a permission wall is not a
  durability boundary. The service user must be able to open-for-read
  every ancestor that mkdir durability syncs (typical `0750`/`0755` under
  `/var/lib/webhook-wake`). A `0300` write+search parent cannot persist a
  newly created child and is rejected. `/ready` inspects the same
  ancestor contract without creating or rewriting state: the creation
  directory needs read+write+search, and every further ancestor that
  commit would fsync needs read+search. A `0300` state dir or ancestor
  is unready before any wake. A truncated or invalid `.dirsync`
  marker stays fail-closed and is never rewritten into a shorter chain;
  a missing marker still recovers by syncing existing ancestors.
  Pending `.dirsync` is validated on `get`/`reserveCapacity` (recover
  still happens at commit) so a persistent bad marker, or a syntactically
  valid marker whose existing components are not openable directories
  (FIFO/file), returns 503 with zero wake. Directory fsync opens with
  `O_DIRECTORY|O_NONBLOCK` and does not claim a TOCTOU defense.
  At-least-once, not exactly-once. A new
  event reserves a dedup slot through send+commit (released on failure)
  so a concurrent observe record cannot steal the last slot after a
  canary wake has started.
- In-memory wake history is off by default (`wakeHistoryLimit=0`).
- The external monitor keeps state under `/var/lib/webhook-wake-monitor`
  (not `/tmp`) and never sources that file as shell. Across-run persistence
  already exists via `StateDirectory`. `save()` is an atomic rename without
  fsync: a crash between write and disk flush may roll back one tick
  (`last_alert` / `alarming`). That is an explicit monitor limitation, not
  the receiver 2xx durability contract; FC may confirm the disposition.
  Recovery during cooldown is pending and emitted on a later tick.
  A failed `health_recovered` delivery does **not** advance
  `lastAlertAtMs` / `last_alert`; the next healthy tick retries without
  a full cooldown (`monitor.ts` matches `monitor.sh` here). A failed
  `health_failed` in the TypeScript helper still stamps `lastAlertAtMs`
  so a down sink is not hammered every interval — that is **not** claimed
  as shell parity (`monitor.sh` stamps `last_alert` only after a
  successful `health_failed`).
  The probe requires an exact HTTP **200** (no redirect follow; 3xx/4xx/5xx
  are failures) in **both** `templates/monitor.sh` and `httpProbe`.
  `httpProbe` accepts only `http:`/`https:`; `ftp:`, `file:`, and other
  schemes or a malformed URL return `{ ok: false }` and never throw
  (`ERR_INVALID_PROTOCOL` is contained). Socket `timeout` is inactivity
  only; `httpProbe` also starts an independent wall-clock deadline of the
  same `timeoutMs`, destroys the request on expiry, and clears the timer
  on every completion path so a drip of incomplete headers cannot hang
  the probe. That is probe correctness, not
  an alert-URL SSRF policy. Alert
  execution requires a `timeout` binary; a missing tool fails visibly and
  never runs the alerter unbounded. `alertHook.url` POSTs with
  `redirect: manual` and accepts only HTTP 200 — redirects are not
  followed (trusted-operator URL; no extra DNS/private-network policy).
  After status, the hook cancels the response body on both 200 and
  non-200 so a never-ending chunked sink cannot retain sockets.
  Authenticated mapping/stale failures coalesce alerts per code (first
  fire, then cooldown) so sender retries stay 503 without flooding the
  sink.
  Install rename (required so the timer `Unit=` resolves):
  `monitor.service` → `/etc/systemd/system/webhook-wake-monitor.service`,
  `monitor.timer` → `/etc/systemd/system/webhook-wake-monitor.timer`,
  `monitor.sh` → `/usr/local/bin/webhook-wake-monitor.sh`.
  The oneshot unit uses `DynamicUser=yes` (not shared `nobody`) with
  `StateDirectory=webhook-wake-monitor` and `Wants=network-online.target`
  so boot probes wait for a configured online service. `ALERT_BIN` stays
  an absolute helper; this tree does not create users or deploy units.
- Secret files on Linux must be mode `0600` (group/other bits fail load).
  Load uses one fd: `O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK` + `fstat` + read
  (symlink → `secret_symlink`; FIFO/dir → `secret_not_file` without a
  blocking open). That is a local operator-directory trust boundary,
  not a new credential policy. `templates/canary.whs.example` is
  deliberately **not** a valid `whs_` hex secret until replaced.
  `alertHook.url` is trusted-operator config; this example does not add
  SSRF/network policy (upstream API already pins egress). Oversized
  bodies return HTTP 413 on the live connection; unknown unauthenticated
  routes never call the alert hook. Pre-body rejects (unknown route,
  oversize signature header, busy, malformed route encoding, other/method
  404) flush the status then drain and close so an unfinished
  Content-Length cannot linger after the request timer is cleared.
  Request timeout aborts an unfinished
  body read and frees the concurrent slot; a later completed wake+dedup
  is not cancelled.
  `killSpawnedJob` skips a child whose `exitCode`/`signalCode` is already
  set. That does **not** close kernel PID reuse; this example does not
  add pidfd.
- **Deploy checklist (guidance, not a substitute for timeout/slots):**
  rate-limit public `/hooks` at the proxy or host filter you already
  operate. nginx (standard `limit_req`; zone belongs in `http {}`):
  `limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=webhook_wake:10m rate=10r/s;`
  then `limit_req zone=webhook_wake burst=20 nodelay;` **inside**
  `location /hooks/` (not beside `/health`). `/health` stays unthrottled.
  This tree does **not** invent a Caddy rate-limit module directive.
  Non-loopback bind requires `listen.allowNonLoopback: true` (load-time
  reject otherwise; no new request limiter). Route 404 vs 401 stays a
  documented non-secret distinction. `alertHook.url` still trusts the
  operator for reachability, but load accepts only `http:`/`https:`
  (`config_invalid:alertHook.url` for other schemes). Timer values are
  load-capped to the recommended bands below (and far below 2^31−1).

## Recommended numeric ranges (load-enforced where noted)

These ranges describe operator defaults and load-time constraints.
Present values must already be integers of the documented sign.
Extra load rules today: `listen.port` (0–65535), `dedup.retentionMs`
(≥72h + 1h delivery margin), `dedup.path` (absolute),
`requestTimeoutMs` / `sendTimeoutMs` / `alertHook.timeoutMs` (positive
integers capped at the recommended upper band; also
`requestTimeoutMs >= sendTimeoutMs + 2000` or
`config_invalid:requestTimeoutMs.headroom`), `alertHook.url`
(`http:`/`https:` or `null`), and `listen.allowNonLoopback` (required
`true` when `listen.host` is not loopback).

| Field | Default | Current load rule | Recommended band | Runtime / misconfig note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listen.port` | 8787 | integer 0–65535 | 1024–65535 (0 = kernel ephemeral) | Bind failure is startup-fatal. |
| `bodyLimitBytes` | 16384 | integer > 0 | 4096–65536 | Metadata events are small; too low yields 413. |
| `timestampToleranceSec` | 300 | integer > 0 | 60–600 | Replay window. Large values accept stale signatures. |
| `maxV1Signatures` | 8 | integer > 0 | 2–16 | Rotation candidates. Too low rejects a valid current+previous header. |
| `maxHeaderBytes` | 2048 | integer > 0 | 2048–8192 | **UTF-8 byte** length (`Buffer.byteLength`). The parser and `createServer({ maxHeaderSize })` use `maxHeaderBytes + 4096` so other request headers fit. If that total exceeds the process `http.maxHeaderSize` (Bun default 16384), **load fails** (`config_invalid:maxHeaderBytes_exceeds_transport`). Raise the runtime (`bun --max-http-header-size=…`) before promising a larger signature. Too small → 401 `invalid_header`. |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | 10000 | integer 1–30000 | 2000–30000 | Aborts an unfinished **HTTP body read** and frees the concurrent slot. Does not kill an already-spawned Orca child. Must be ≥ `sendTimeoutMs` + 2000. |
| `maxConcurrent` | 16 | integer > 0 | 1–64 | In-flight HTTP cap. `0` fails load. Too low → 503 `busy`. |
| `sendTimeoutMs` | 8000 | integer 1–30000 | 1000–30000 | SIGKILL of the **spawned job process group** after this budget. Must leave ≥2s headroom under `requestTimeoutMs` (see Timer distinction). Too small → 503 `timeout_killed`. |
| `outputCapBytes` | 4096 | integer > 0 | 1024–16384 | Bound on **retained** child stdout/stderr counts. Excess is drained and discarded (not pipe-destroyed) so a zero-exit send still commits. |
| `wakeHistoryLimit` | 0 | integer ≥ 0 | 0–128 | In-memory ring only. `0` disables history. |
| `dedup.path` | `/var/lib/webhook-wake/dedup.json` | absolute file path | absolute file path | Relative paths, trailing separators (`/tmp/x.json/`), and root-as-file (`/`) fail load (`config_invalid:dedup.path`) before any store I/O. Present `dedup` must be an object (`config_invalid:dedup`). |
| `dedup.retentionMs` | 604800000 (7d) | integer ≥ 262800000 (72h + 1h) | 73h–30d | Replay/dedup window. Must outlast the producer's pinned 11th attempt at +72h; exactly 72h fails load so ordinary delivery latency cannot expire the record and re-wake. |
| `dedup.maxRecords` | 10000 | integer > 0 | 1000–100000 | Fail-closed when full (no eviction of live keys). |
| `alertHook.timeoutMs` | 2000 | integer 1–10000 | 500–10000 | Receiver hook POST budget only. |

External monitor timers (templates, not JSON config): probe interval **30s**,
`FAIL_THRESHOLD` **2**, `COOLDOWN_SEC` **300**, curl `--max-time` **5**,
`ALERT_TIMEOUT_SEC` **2**. The shell validates those three as unsigned
integers before arithmetic (`FAIL_THRESHOLD` ≥ 1, `COOLDOWN_SEC` ≥ 0,
`ALERT_TIMEOUT_SEC` ≥ 1, at most 9 digits). Oversized all-digit strings
are rejected the same way so POSIX `[` cannot skip the comparison.
Malformed values print `monitor_config_invalid`
and exit 2. Persisted `consecutive` is at most 9 digits;
`last_alert` and injected `NOW_SEC` are Unix seconds with at most
**10** digits (current epoch width). Leading-zero decimals (`08`, `09`)
are rejected so dash does not treat them as invalid octal. Overlong
all-digit state prints
`monitor_config_invalid_state` and exit 2 — the env 9-digit cap is
**not** applied to timestamps. Recommended: interval 15–60s, threshold 2–5,
cooldown 60–900s, curl 2–10s, alert timeout 1–5s. A future persisted
`last_alert` is treated as **not** in cooldown.

**Timer distinction:** `requestTimeoutMs` is the inbound HTTP deadline
(starts before body handling and wake/send). `sendTimeoutMs` is the
child-kill deadline after a wake starts. Because the request timer is
already running when send begins, load requires
`requestTimeoutMs >= sendTimeoutMs + 2000` (2s headroom for body/orchestration;
`config_invalid:requestTimeoutMs.headroom` otherwise) so a full send budget
can still elapse. Caps stay ≤30000 — do not raise them to invent headroom.
Setting either far below the other still does not compensate: a late body
can complete a wake if the request already passed to send, and a tiny send
budget kills a healthy child while the HTTP slot is still open.

**Runtime timer range + load-time caps:**
`requestTimeoutMs`, `sendTimeoutMs`, and `alertHook.timeoutMs` are passed
to `setTimeout` (and `requestTimeoutMs` also to `http.Server.requestTimeout`
/ `headersTimeout`). Node.js timers
(https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/timers.html#settimeoutcallback-delay-args)
keep `delay` in a signed 32-bit millisecond range. If `delay` is larger
than **2147483647** (~24.8 days), the runtime sets the duration to
**1 ms** and emits `TimeoutOverflowWarning`. This example now **rejects
at load** any value above the recommended upper band
(`requestTimeoutMs`/`sendTimeoutMs` ≤ 30000,
`alertHook.timeoutMs` ≤ 10000; `config_invalid:<field>`), which also
covers the >2^31−1 overflow case. Caps match the README recommended
bands (not an arbitrary multiple of the default). `dedup.retentionMs`
and `timestampToleranceSec` are wall-clock comparisons, not
`setTimeout`. Monitor `COOLDOWN_SEC` / systemd `OnUnitActiveSec` are
shell/unit seconds, not JS timers.

**Deploy verification:** `bun src/main.ts --config <file>` starts a
**persistent listener**. It does **not** exit 0 after a successful bind.
`startup_not_ready` is only logged; the process still calls
`listenReceiver` and stays up. Success is all of: the process remains
running; a `listening` log with the bound URL; loopback
`GET /ready` returns **HTTP 200** with `ready: true`. HTTP 503 on
`/ready` means the socket is up but mappings/state are not ready.
Then POST one signed canary with the intended header size/rotation
count and confirm `/health` from the monitor host. Check that a
deliberate oversize header is 401 and that a write-without-search
state directory or a `0300` (write+search, no read) state/ancestor is unready.

Config shape/numbers without starting a service (existing
`parseFileConfig`, `loadSecrets: false`; no new CLI). Prints `config_ok`
and exits; does not bind a port or **open** secret files. `secretFile`
must still be a nonempty string, and a present `previousSecretFile`
must be a nonempty string or `null`. A valid path that does not exist
is allowed in preflight; a real load still fails on a missing file.
`alertHook`, if present, must be an object (string/array/null/scalar
fail load) so a typo cannot silently disable the sink. `alertHook.url`
`null` disables the sink; an explicit empty string fails load
(`config_invalid:alertHook.url`). A non-null URL must parse as
`http:` or `https:` (other schemes fail load with the same code). A present `canaryTerminal` must be
`null` or a nonempty valid terminal handle, including observe mode
(`false` / `0` / `""` / whitespace fail load). Absent or `null` means
no canary. Canary mode still requires a bound terminal. The JSON document root must be a
non-array object (`config_invalid:root`); an array, scalar, or `null`
root does not load as empty defaults. Present `listen` must be a non-array
object; a present invalid `host` fails (`config_invalid:listen.host`)
instead of silently binding `127.0.0.1`. A non-loopback `host` requires
`allowNonLoopback: true` or load fails (`config_invalid:listen.allowNonLoopback`). Present `dedup`
must likewise be an object (`config_invalid:dedup`). IPv6 listen
addresses are bracketed in `receiver.url()` (`http://[::1]:port`).
`httpProbe` strips those brackets before `http.request` so a
`http://[::1]:port` health URL uses host `::1`.
Readiness `inspectDedupFile` is fail-closed on any malformed record
(`state_corrupt`). Existing non-regular state (FIFO/dir) is
`state_not_file` before any synchronous read. Same-family `.dirsync`
and `.unacked` markers are inspected the same way; a FIFO marker is
`state_dirsync_not_file` / fail-closed unacked and is never
`readFileSync`'d or `writeFileSync`'d. Runtime `DedupStore.readFile`
still skips malformed
entries so a later valid commit can recover — that split is existing
recovery, not a new repair policy. A sticky parent that is writable
can still be unready when the existing target is owned by another UID;
that check is not a complete TOCTOU defense.

```bash
bun -e 'import { parseFileConfig } from "./src/config.ts";
const raw = JSON.parse(await Bun.file(process.argv[1]).text());
parseFileConfig(raw, { loadSecrets: false });
console.log("config_ok");' -- /path/to/config.json
```

## Local run

```bash
# Copy templates; keep real whs_ files outside git (mode 0600).
cp templates/config.example.json /tmp/webhook-wake-config.json
# point secretFile at a local file, listen on 127.0.0.1, mode=observe
bun src/main.ts --config /tmp/webhook-wake-config.json
```

- `GET /health` — process liveness only (public monitor probe).
- `GET /ready` — mappings, secret/state readiness, stale/inactive visibility.
  Unauthenticated on purpose; keep it private by deployment (loopback
  and/or reverse-proxy exclude). Not an authentication endpoint.
- `POST /hooks/<routeKey>` — signed webhook.

Requires Bun `>=1.2.21` (tested with the workspace Bun). Example typecheck
uses the TypeScript and `@types/node` already installed under
`packages/api/node_modules` (`bun run typecheck`); no new dependency is
added.

```bash
bun test
bun run typecheck
```

The suite uses a fake Orca binary and a loopback HTTP server. It is not
evidence of a real mailbox wake, HTTPS edge, or external alarm.

## Deployment notes (not authorized by this card)

Recommended later: run as the VPS `ops` user next to the working Orca runtime;
terminate TLS on 443 and proxy to the loopback listener. Monitor from a
**different** host (probe `/health` every 30s, alarm after two failures,
recovery notice, cooldown). Templates live in `templates/`.

**Bun path substitution (install, not a host change in this tree):**
`templates/webhook-wake.service` and `templates/webhook-wake.user.service`
ship `ExecStart=/usr/bin/bun …` only as a documented placeholder. After
copying a unit, replace `/usr/bin/bun` with the absolute executable the
service user can run, for example:

```bash
# as the service user (ops) or the user-instance owner
command -v bun
# then edit ExecStart= to that path; confirm it is executable by that user
# (world-exec or owned by the service user). Do not create a /usr/bin/bun
# symlink from this example.
```

This card does not deploy units or create host symlinks.

Endpoint health does not prove an OAE subscription is enabled. After a real
deploy order: confirm the subscription, rotate secrets, and measure test-mail
to a visible seat notification (target ≤10s). Keep old sentinels up through a
24h shadow comparison. This README does not publish hostnames, seats, or
secrets.

## Negative controls

No API/compose/workflow/dependency edits, no live subscription, no production
knock, no sentinel retirement.
