# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. The project is Apache-2.0; by contributing you agree your
work is licensed under the same terms.

## Layout

- `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `deploy/` — the deployment stack
  (docker-mailserver + API), DNS wizard, and doctor script
- `packages/api` — the REST API (IMAP/SMTP bridge to the catch-all mailbox)
- `packages/mcp` — the MCP server wrapping the REST API
- `packages/setup` — the `npx @openagentemail/setup` onboarding CLI
- Website and docs live in a separate repo: `openagentemail/website`

## Development

1. Clone, `cp .env.example .env`, set `DOMAIN` to a throwaway domain you own.
2. `docker compose up -d`, then `./deploy/doctor.sh` to confirm the stack is healthy.
3. Work in `packages/api`, `packages/mcp`, or `packages/setup`; each is a plain
   Node/Bun package with its own README.

### Tests

All tests must pass before a PR is considered:

Python 3.12.3 (or a compatible Python 3 exposing `python3`) is an API-test
prerequisite: it runs the independent approval canonical-vector corpus check.
CI installs Python 3.12.3 explicitly; local contributors must install it before
running the API suite.

Decision (#101): local API `bun test` stays **fail-closed** when `python3` is
missing — the independent verifier is not skipped. A skip-with-reason path
would let corpus drift pass on a Python-less laptop and only fail in CI. CI
continues to install Python 3.12.3 and run both `check:approval-publication`
and the same bun suite.

```bash
cd packages/api   && npx -y bun test
cd packages/mcp   && npx -y bun test && npx -y bun run build
cd packages/setup && npx -y bun test && npx -y bun run build
```

Add or update tests for behavior changes. If the change touches the compose stack,
run a clean-stack acceptance check (see `packages/api/dev/` for examples).

## Rules of thumb

- Keep the REST contract and the MCP tool surface in sync — every REST operation
  has a `mail_*` tool and vice versa.
- No new runtime dependencies outside Docker containers; the whole stack must stay
  `docker compose up -d`-able.
- Docs changes go in the same PR as behavior changes.
- Scope stays focused: no unrelated cleanup or drive-by reformatting.

## How we review (including AI-assisted contributions)

Maintainers and agents alike follow the same bar:

1. **Independent review before merge.** Non-trivial changes get a review pass from
   someone (or some agent) other than the author. For agent-written code we require
   an independently spawned review agent — self-review does not count.
2. **CI must be green.** The `test` workflow runs the full suite on every PR.
3. **Sensitive paths need maintainer sign-off**: authentication, token handling,
   `.github/workflows/`, and release configuration.
4. **Security issues are not PRs.** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Open an issue before large changes. Small fixes (typos, docs, bugs with a repro)
can go straight to a PR.

## External pull requests

What to expect when you open a PR from a fork:

- **First response within 48 hours.** We triage every external PR — real bug /
  conflict with main / scope question — and leave a comment so you know someone
  is on it.
- **Same merge bar as maintainers**: green CI, CodeRabbit success, all review
  threads resolved, and a maintainer's final review. CI on fork PRs runs only
  after a maintainer approves it (a GitHub safeguard, not a judgment on you).
- **Conflicts with main**: for a small, aging PR we may take it over — land the
  fix on a maintainer branch with you credited via `Co-authored-by`, thank you
  in your PR, and close it as superseded. Larger or directional changes are
  better rebased by you (or discussed in an issue first).
- **Stale PRs**: after a ping with no response for 14 days we may close the PR
  (you can always reopen it).
- **AI-authored PRs** are held to the same bar as human ones; our review chain
  (bots + maintainer review) provides the independent review, so you do not
  need to arrange your own.

## Issue triage (v1.1)

Every issue gets classified on two axes:

- **Source**: `source: internal` (maintainers/team agents) or `source: external`
  (community). Applied automatically on open.
- **Type**: `bug`, `feature` (label `enhancement`), `follow-up`, `hardening`,
  `docs`, `security`.

Priority is a maintainer decision made at triage, using one shared ruler for
internal and external issues:

- **P0 — firefighting**: production outage, security hole, data corruption.
  Drops everything.
- **P1 — this week**: defects on a core path users are hitting now, or work
  blocking the current roadmap milestone.
- **P2 — this month**: valuable but not urgent; tech-debt batches; roadmap
  items outside the current milestone.
- **P3 — recorded**: theoretical corners, nice-to-haves, ideas not aligned
  with the roadmap right now. Recording it is the completion.

External issues additionally follow three rules:

1. **First response within 24 hours.** Even "got it, looking" counts. A
   maintainer-side patrol (run outside this repository) watches the external
   queue and escalates; a human still writes or approves every posted reply.
2. **Feature requests pass a roadmap-alignment check.** Aligned → scheduled as
   P1/P2. Valuable but misaligned → parked at P3 with a courteous explanation.
   Declined → closed with thanks and one sentence of reasoning. Silence is not
   an answer we give.
3. **Security reports go private.** We redirect to the channel in
   [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of discussing details in public.

Labels: `source: internal|external`, `prio: P0|P1|P2|P3`, plus the type labels
above. An issue is triaged when it carries a source label, a type, and a
priority. Issues labeled `needs-info` are closed automatically after 14 days
of no issue activity plus a 7-day grace period (see `stale-needs-info.yml`).
