# RFC-0001: Outbound event webhooks

- **Status:** **Accepted** — ratified 2026-09-03. Superseded the earlier "Proposed — draft
  for owner ratification" state. Acceptance authorizes the six PRs in §15 to be scheduled;
  it commits no schedule, and PR 2 must not start until its owner is named (**D8**).
- **Date:** 2026-09-03 (drafted and ratified the same day)
- **Decisions:** all seventeen open questions are answered itemized in **§17**. Four were
  decided by the owner (D1–D4), thirteen approved by the commander at recommended values
  (D5–D17), and one derived consequence (**D2a**) was ruled on separately, overriding this
  document's proposal. Five new questions (**Q18**–**Q22**) were opened by the review rounds
  and remain for the owner. Where §16 still reads as open, §17 is authoritative.
- **Issue:** [#109](https://github.com/openagentemail/openagentemail/issues/109)
- **Decision scope:** event catalog, payload schema, signing and verification, delivery
  semantics (retry, ordering, dead letters), SSRF and egress safety, configuration
  surface (env + REST), coexistence with `mail_wait_for`, and the secret/rotation model.
- **Out of scope:** auto-reply / responder engines (#105), cross-domain federation
  (#59), inbound webhooks (external system → OAE), any change to the mail or task
  state machines, and hosted-plan billing or quota policy.
- **Implementation code:** none. This is a design document. Code-shaped blocks below are
  wire-format illustrations and operator commands, not a reference implementation.

> On numbering: this repository keeps architecture decision records under
> `design/adr-NNNN-*.md`, but that sequence is numbered outside this repo (only
> `design/adr-0026-dashboard-revamp.md` is committed here), so this document does not
> claim an ADR number. If ratified, it should be adopted as the next `design/adr-NNNN`

## 1. Summary

OpenAgentEmail today is **pull-only**. An agent that wants to know whether mail arrived
must ask: `mail_wait_for` long-polls `POST /v1/messages/wait`, watchers poll IMAP, humans
refresh the dashboard. The server never speaks first.

This RFC proposes **outbound event webhooks**: an operator (or an identity-scoped agent
token) registers an HTTPS callback URL, and OAE POSTs a small signed JSON event to it
when something happens — starting with `mail.received`.

The design deliberately reuses four subsystems that already exist and are already
hardened, rather than inventing parallel ones:

| Need | Existing subsystem to reuse | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound-mail event source | the process-wide IMAP IDLE loop with a UID high-water mark | `packages/api/src/lib/notification-watcher.ts:1602` |
| SSRF / egress safety | the single shared IP policy + DNS-pinned fetcher | `packages/api/src/lib/net.ts:1`, `packages/api/src/lib/oauth-cimd.ts:363` |
| Payload bounding | push content tiers and their byte caps | `packages/api/src/lib/identities.ts:53`, `notification-watcher.ts:54-70` |
| Delivery log / dead-letter inspection | append-only 30-day JSONL + inspection API | `packages/api/src/lib/notification-log.ts`, `routes/ui.ts:1048` |

The decisions that carry the most risk are **not** cryptographic. They are:

1. **The event source is currently gated on ntfy.** Webhooks hooked into the existing
   watcher loop would silently not fire on any deployment that does not run ntfy, and ntfy
   is off by default (§11.4). Fixing this means refactoring a loop that works today.
2. **"Reuse the existing SSRF policy" is a trap as stated.** The shared policy permits
   private addresses *unless* told otherwise, and the flag that tells it otherwise defaults
   to off. Naively reusing it would let any token holder point OAE at the compose-internal
   network — the exact attack §9.6 exists to describe. §9.1 gives the one-line composition
   rule that prevents this, and §14 item 2 makes it the highest-value test in the feature.
3. **Webhooks invert who must be network-reachable.** Long-polling requires the *agent* to
   reach OAE; webhooks require OAE to reach the *agent*. Neither replaces the other, and
   the long-poll path must not be deprecated (§11.2).

Consequently three of the six PRs in §15 touch production code that predates this feature
—the SSRF fetcher extraction, the event-bus refactor, and exposing the existing mail cursor
on the bearer API (§3.7) — and those, not the signing scheme, are where the implementation
risk lives.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### 2.1 v1 goals

1. Deliver `mail.received` **and `approval.requested`** events to operator-registered
   HTTPS endpoints, at-least-once. Two event types, not one — decision **D1** (§17).
2. Sign every delivery with HMAC-SHA256 so a consumer can prove authenticity and reject
   replays, and document verification **before** documenting anything else.
3. Bound payloads structurally: a webhook never carries a full mail body (§6.5).
4. Refuse to become an SSRF amplifier or a DDoS reflector — reusing the existing shared
   IP policy rather than writing a second one, **and** composing it correctly, which is
   not the same thing (§9.1).
5. Fail visible: a broken endpoint is a surfaced health signal, never a silent drop.
6. Coexist cleanly with `mail_wait_for`; consume no wait slots (§11).
7. Be configurable entirely through the repo's existing env, REST, and MCP-tool
   conventions (§10), with no new datastore technology.
8. Ship a **read-only** dashboard panel under Configure showing subscriptions, deliveries,
   and dead letters (§10.8) — decision **D4** (§17), which reverses this document's
   original "no new UI" non-goal. Read-only is the whole scope: no create, edit, rotate, or
   delete from the browser in v1.

### 2.2 Non-goals (explicit)

These are refused for v1, not deferred by accident:

- **No auto-reply / auto-forward / responder engine.** #105 asks for a built-in
  `agent.yaml` LLM responder. This RFC is the substrate that lets an operator build that
  in userland; it does not build it. A rules engine in core would inherit prompt
  injection from every inbound mail body, which is a materially worse threat surface
  than pushing metadata to an endpoint the operator chose.
- **No federation.** #59's cross-domain signed task envelopes need asymmetric
  signatures, `.well-known` discovery, trusted-domain allowlists, and replay nonces.
  None of that is here. §7.6 explains why the v1 signature header is nonetheless shaped
  so that a future asymmetric scheme is additive rather than breaking.
- **No inbound webhooks** (external system POSTs in and becomes mail or a task).
  Different trust direction, different auth model, different abuse surface. Separate card.
- **No events beyond `mail.received` and `approval.requested`.** `mail.sent`, `task.*`,
  `approval.decided`, `approval.expired`, and lease lifecycle events get **reserved names**
  (§5.2) so that adding them later is not a breaking change.

  **`approval.expired` is explicitly deferred to v1.1, and the reason is a missing emitter,
  not a missing design.** Expiry is not observed when it happens: `materializeApprovalExpiry()`
  (`tasks-internal.ts:1444`) makes an expired approval terminal only when something next
  reads it, and its own source comment states the rule — *"Service detail reads lazily make
  an expired approval terminal. There is no scheduler or list sweep: only the next
  detail/wait/decision observes it"* (`tasks-internal.ts:1442`, translated). Called only from
  `getTask()` (`:1454`) and the decision path (`:2454`), so an approval that nobody looks at
  never transitions at all. A webhook cannot be emitted at a moment nothing observes.
  Making `approval.expired` real therefore requires **a reaper or list sweep** that advances
  expired approvals on a timer — new production machinery with its own locking and
  idempotency questions, because it would race `materializeApprovalExpiry()` on the same task
  lock. That is a separate PR and a separate review, so v1 ships the two events that already
  have clean emission sites and `approval.expired` waits for the reaper.

  `approval.decided` is *not* blocked the same way — `decideApprovalTask()`
  (`tasks-internal.ts:2440`) is a clean emitter — but it is still out of v1 because D1 scoped
  v1 to the two events that serve #109's stated unlocks, and adding a third would grow the
  authorization and payload work without a requested use case.
- **No ordering guarantee, and no exactly-once delivery.** Both are documented as
  absent rather than approximated (§8.1, §8.4).
- **No durable queue surviving restart with full fidelity.** §8.6 states precisely what
  is and is not recovered across a process restart.
- **No *write* operations from the dashboard.** Decision **D4** (§17) reversed this
  document's original "no new UI" non-goal: v1 ships a read-only panel (§10.8). What remains
  refused is mutating webhook state from a browser session — create, update, rotate, delete,
  enable, and redeliver stay on the bearer REST API. The panel is for *diagnosis* ("why did
  my endpoint stop getting mail?"), not for administration, which keeps the cookie-session
  surface (`requireUiOrigin`, `uiSessionBodyLimit`) out of the secret-handling paths
  entirely.
- **No batching, no bulk subscribe, no consumer-supplied rate limits.**
- **No replacement of `mail_wait_for`.** It stays, unchanged, first-class (§11.5).

## 3. What already exists in this repository

This section is factual, not propositional. Every claim is cited so a reviewer can check
it; the design in §4–§13 depends on these specifics.

### 3.1 The inbound-mail event source

Mail is not stored on the API's filesystem. `packages/api/src/lib/imap.ts` talks to a
single catch-all Dovecot mailbox over IMAP, one-shot connection per call. Identities are
matched to messages by `To` / `Cc` / `Delivered-To`.

Exactly one place in the process observes each new message once:

- `startNotificationWatcher()` (`notification-watcher.ts:1602`) runs one process-wide
  loop, started from `main.ts:42`.
- `watchConnection()` maintains a **UID high-water mark** (`WatcherWatermark`), races
  `client.idle()` against a 3 s heartbeat, re-anchors on `UIDVALIDITY` change, and
  reconnects with 2 s → 120 s backoff.
- `processWatchedMessage()` parses the message and applies policy and content-tier
  gating before publishing.

By contrast, `POST /v1/messages/wait` (`routes/messages.ts:78`) is per-caller and
**has no cursor**: for an ordinary mail wait, `findMatchWith()` pages the newest 20 inbox
messages (`imap.ts:1013`) and returns the newest match, so an already-present message
returns immediately. (Task waits deliberately bypass that view and do a full-mailbox
header search instead — `imap.ts:1003-1012`, with a source comment explaining that a busy
identity can receive many unrelated messages while a task runs. The newest-20 limit is
specific to `mail_wait_for`.) Duplicate avoidance is the caller's job either way. The wait
path is therefore unsuitable as an event source, and webhooks must not be built on it.

**Startup gate (the problem):** the loop is gated twice on ntfy —

```
main.ts:40                     if (config.ntfy.enabled) { … startNotificationWatcher(); }
notification-watcher.ts:1603   if (!config.ntfy.enabled || config.ntfy.pushPolicy === 'none') return () => {};
```

### 3.2 Existing SSRF policy

`lib/net.ts:1` describes itself (translated from the Chinese source comment) as *"the single
shared implementation for hostname / IP private-network and SSRF decisions — CIMD SSRF and
the MCP insecure-issuer gate both go through here; copying another one is forbidden."* That
mandate is binding on this design, and §9.1 shows it is not as simple as calling the
function.

- `isBlockedSsrfIp()` (`net.ts:156`) **always** blocks `169.254.0.0/16`, `0.0.0.0/8`,
  `fe80::/10`, and `fd00:ec2::/16` (AWS IMDS over IPv6), including IPv4-mapped IPv6
  forms via `ipv4MappedFromV6()` (`net.ts:126`).
- `isSsrfBlockedResolvedIp()` (`net.ts:225`) additionally blocks multicast, `::`, and
  special-use space, and permits RFC1918 / CGNAT / loopback / ULA **only** under the
  private-deployment exception — which `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true` (`config.ts:214`) turns off.
  Always-blocked ranges never count as "private" (`net.ts:205`).

The reference *consumer* of that policy is `pinnedCimdFetcher()`
(`oauth-cimd.ts:363`), which is the DNS-rebinding defense already proven in this
codebase: it uses Node `http`/`https` with a **custom `lookup` hook that re-checks every
resolved A/AAAA record at connect time**, so there is no gap between "the name resolved
to a safe address" and "the socket connected to that address". It also sets a 10 s
timeout and caps the response at 5 KiB via a streaming read (`oauth-cimd.ts:450`).
Redirect refusal sits one layer up, in the CIMD document-fetch wrapper, which sets
`redirect: 'manual'` (`oauth-cimd.ts:526`) and rejects any 3xx as `redirect_forbidden`
(`oauth-cimd.ts:543`); §9.1 explains why that layering changes the phasing.

### 3.3 Signing conventions

| Mechanism | Algorithm | Key | Domain separator | Encoding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `taskStamp` (`tasks-internal.ts:458`) | HMAC-SHA256 over `\n`-joined fields | `config.taskSigningSecret` | implicit in field tuple | base64url |
| approval digest (`tasks-internal.ts:442`) | SHA-256 over canonical JSON | — | `approval-action-v1` shape | lower-case hex |
| `X-OA-Mail-Stamp` (`mail-stamp.ts:25`) | HMAC-SHA256 | `config.taskSigningSecret` | `mail-stamp-v1` | base64url |
| mail body hash (`mail-stamp.ts:22`) | SHA-256 | — | `mail-body-v2` | base64url |
| mail cursor (`mail-cursor.ts:12`) | HMAC-SHA256 | `config.taskSigningSecret` | `mail-cursor-v1` | base64url |
| notify cursor (`config.ts:309`) | HMAC-SHA256 **key derivation** | `config.taskSigningSecret` | `notify-cursor-v1` | raw bytes |

Three conventions matter for this RFC:

**(a) Domain separation by HMAC-deriving a subkey from the root secret, with no new env
var.** `config.ts:308` says so explicitly (translated from the Chinese comment): *"the
notify cursor is domain-separated from
the task/mail cursors; no new env var is added."*

**(b) Length-prefixing to kill boundary ambiguity.** `mail-body-v2` hashes
`mail-body-v2\nlen(text)\ntext\nlen(html)\nhtml` (`mail-stamp.ts:36`, `:79`) precisely so
that two different field splits cannot produce the same signed bytes.

**(c) The anti-oracle rule.** `mail-stamp.ts:141` writes the stamp **only when every
recipient is on-domain**, because `taskSigningSecret` may fall back to `SMTP_PASS`
(`config.ts:281`) and a mixed/external recipient could otherwise use the stamp as an
HMAC oracle over that secret. Verification is constant-time (`timingSafeEqual`,
`mail-stamp.ts:115`) and fails closed.

`config.ts:270-280` already turns (c) into a boot-time rule for the one existing feature
that sends data to an external party: if `ALWAYS_BCC` is set, an explicit
`TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` of ≥ 32 characters is **required**, and the `SMTP_PASS` fallback is
refused. §12.1 applies the same rule to webhooks.

### 3.4 Payload bounding precedent

Per-identity `pushContentTier: 1 | 2 | 3`, default 1 (`identities.ts:48`,
`resolvePushContentTier()` at `:53`, admin-only setter at `:396`). Unknown tier values
read back as the default (`identities.ts:100`) — a forward-compatibility rule worth
copying.

- Tier 1: interrupt only — "address received new email", plus a **boolean** that an OTP
  or verification link is present. No values.
- Tier 2: adds From/Subject, masked (`maskTier2Metadata()`, `notification-watcher.ts:936`).
- Tier 3: adds body preview and OTP codes/links, and marks the log row `sensitive: true`.

Caps (`notification-watcher.ts:54-70`): `PUSH_BODY_PREVIEW_CHARS = 280`,
`PUSH_OTP_ITEM_MAX = 5`, `PUSH_OTP_ENTRY_CHARS = 200`, `PUSH_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES = 3500`,
`PUSH_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES = 400`. The ntfy transport cap is
`NTFY_REQUEST_MAX_BYTES = 4_000` (`notify.ts:752`), with a defined overflow order (drop
click, then truncate-or-error). Byte-safe truncation is `truncateUtf8Bytes()`
(`lib/utf8-truncate.ts:15`).

### 3.5 Delivery-log precedent

`notification-log.ts` writes append-only `DATA_DIR/notification-log.jsonl`, 0600, single
writer, retained 30 days (`NOTIFICATION_LOG_RETENTION_MS`), written only after a
successful publish (plus failed-urgent rows). It is read back through
`GET /ui/api/notifications` and `/ui/api/notify/summary`. That is a working
dead-letter/inspection pattern to mirror.

Retry today is shallow: `publishWithRetry()` makes `PUBLISH_MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3` attempts
with 250 → 500 ms backoff (`notification-watcher.ts:47`, `:171`), and on a provider-wide
outage the UID is retained for at most `SERVICE_FAILURE_MAX_MS = 10 min` (`:50`) before
the watcher logs CRITICAL and **skips the message permanently**. There is no durable
queue. Webhooks need a longer budget than 10 minutes, because the consumer is an
external party that may be mid-deploy — but not orders of magnitude longer (§8.3).

### 3.6 Config, route, and error conventions

- Env: one zod schema (`config.ts:91-230`), parsed once at import
  (`export const config = parseConfig(process.env)`, `:345`), so a bad value fails the
  boot rather than the request. SCREAMING_SNAKE with feature namespaces (`NTFY_*`,
  `MCP_*`, `TASK_*`, `RETENTION_*`, `OAE_*`).
- Booleans are `z.enum(['true','false'])`, **not** `z.coerce.boolean()`, because Compose
  `${VAR:-}` injects `""` when unset and `emptyAsUndefined` (`config.ts:15`) maps blank
  to undefined so `.default()` applies; a bare string `"false"` is truthy in JS and would
  silently enable things.
- `0` means disabled for numeric limits. URLs go through `envUrl()` (http/https only,
  `config.ts:27`); `DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_URL` additionally rejects userinfo, query, and
  fragment (`config.ts:64`).
- REST: Hono, `/v1` prefix, plural nouns, mounted in `app.ts:104-116`. `bodyLimit`
  (16 MiB, `limits.ts:5`) runs **before** `bearerAuth` (`app.ts:96-103`), returning
  `413 {error:'request_too_large'}`. Reads are GET; mutations are POST including
  sub-resource verbs (`POST /v1/tasks/:id/claim`); `DELETE` is used where deletion is the
  operation (`routes/notify.ts:228`). Success returns a bare object, `201` on create;
  lists wrap in a named key (`{messages}`, `{tasks}`, `{children, nextCursor}`). Errors
  are `{error:'snake_case_code'}` with optional `details` / `retryAfterSec` — with one
  established exception: authorization failures use a prose suffix
  (`'forbidden: token is scoped to another address'`, `auth.ts:218`;
  `'forbidden: admin key required'`, `routes/audit.ts:11`). §10.3 reuses both strings
  verbatim rather than inventing new codes for the same conditions.
- Auth is bearer-only (`auth.ts:180`): `admin` (exact member of `API_KEYS`), `identity`
  (`oa_…` token scoped to one address, stored as a SHA-256 hash), or `oauth` (always
  identity-scoped). `requireAdmin` (`routes/audit.ts:9`) is the admin-gate precedent.
- Rate limiting is an in-memory **sliding window** (`slidingWindowCheck()`,
  `ratelimit.ts:26`), reset on restart by design, with `limit <= 0` disabling. Wait slots
  are capped at `MAX_WAITS_PER_ADDRESS = 3` and `MAX_WAITS_TOTAL = 8` (`ratelimit.ts:205-206`)
  → `429 {error:'too_many_waits', retryAfterSec:5}`.
- Audit is append-only `DATA_DIR/audit.jsonl`, rotated at 10 MiB, with a **field
  whitelist** (`ts, event, clientId?, grantId?, address?, tool?, tier?, outcome,
  durationMs?, ip?`) that structurally cannot carry args, bodies, tokens, or subjects
  (`audit.ts:38-50`), C0-stripping via `scrubAuditField()`, and a `recordAuditEvent()`
  that never throws.
- Secrets at rest: there is no database. Bearer secrets are **never** persisted in
  plaintext — identity tokens and OAuth tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes used as
  lookup keys. `notification-devices.ts:112` hard-refuses to persist any object
  containing a `password` or `token` key. Store files are 0600 in a 0700 directory,
  written atomically via `.tmp` + rename, with fsync of file and directory, and a corrupt
  store fails closed.

### 3.7 The reusable resume token

`mail-cursor.ts` already produces an HMAC-signed opaque cursor binding
`(folder, address, receivedAtMs, uid)`, domain-separated as `mail-cursor-v1`, sortable
newest-first by `(t desc, uid desc)`, and designed specifically to prevent cross-folder /
cross-identity reuse and client forgery of a "next page" token (the source comment at
`mail-cursor.ts:4-6`, translated from Chinese).

**But note precisely where it is exposed — and in which direction it points.** Cursor
pagination is implemented in `listMessagesPageWith()` (`imap.ts:754`) and returned as
`{messages, nextCursor}` (`imap.ts:112-115`), and today it is reachable only through the
**cookie-session dashboard routes** (`routes/ui.ts:758`). The bearer-token API does **not**
accept a cursor: `GET /v1/messages` validates `address` and `limit` only
(`routes/messages.ts:8-11`) and returns a bare `{messages}`.

The direction matters more than the exposure, and the first draft of this section got it
wrong. `listMessagesPageWith()` filters with `isAfterCursor()`, which selects messages
**older** than the cursor (`imap.ts:632-636`, `:786-790`) — it is a *newest-first pagination*
cursor meaning "continue backwards from here". So handing a consumer the cursor from their
last delivered webhook and telling them to pass it back returns **older** mail and silently
omits everything that arrived *after* the outage. That is the opposite of catch-up, and an
integrator following the original text would build a recovery path that misses precisely the
messages it exists to recover.

What is actually reusable, therefore, is the cursor's **construction and signing** — the
`(folder, address, receivedAtMs, uid)` payload, the `mail-cursor-v1` domain separation, and
the address binding that prevents cross-mailbox reuse — not its traversal direction. Making
catch-up work needs a genuinely new query: a forward `since` parameter (or a
`mail-cursor-forward-v1` variant) selecting messages **newer** than the cursor, with the same
signature discipline.

**The forward cursor must also bind `uidValidity`, which the existing one does not.**
`MailCursorPayload` is `(folder, address, t, uid)` (`mail-cursor.ts:22-28`) with no mailbox
generation, which is acceptable for backward pagination within one request but not for a token
a consumer stores across an outage. After an INBOX recreation UIDs restart from scratch
(`notification-watcher.ts:190` records exactly this hazard for the watcher), so a stale
forward cursor would silently select *different* messages that happen to share a UID — the
consumer would believe it had caught up from position X and actually receive unrelated mail,
with no error. The forward cursor therefore carries `uidValidity` in its signed payload, and
**a cursor whose `uidValidity` does not match the current mailbox generation is rejected**
(`400 {error:'invalid_cursor'}`, the code `imap.ts` already folds cursor failures into) rather
than reinterpreted. A consumer hitting that must fall back to a full re-sync, which is the
correct and visible outcome.

That is more than a thin route change, and §15 PR 3 is scoped accordingly. Until it lands, the
`cursor` in a payload is a precise *position marker* a consumer can record and reason about,
but not a token they can spend to resume — and §8.4's catch-up guidance is written to say so
rather than promising a path that does not exist.

## 4. Reference systems: what we borrow and what we refuse

Three families of prior art are worth arguing with. The point of this section is not
"GitHub does X so we do X" — it is to make the trade-offs explicit and to record *why*
each borrowing survives contact with a self-hosted mailbox that has no database.

The vendor facts below were checked against official documentation, not recalled. Where a
vendor publishes no number, this section says so rather than filling the gap — an invented
constant in a design document becomes an invented requirement in an implementation.

### 4.1 GitHub webhooks

**Borrow:**

- **Separate headers for event type and delivery id.** GitHub sends `X-GitHub-Event` and
  `X-GitHub-Delivery` (a UUID unique per delivery attempt) alongside the signature, plus
  `X-GitHub-Hook-ID` and a `GitHub-Hookshot/` user agent. Splitting these lets a consumer
  route and dedupe *before* parsing JSON, and gives a support vocabulary ("which delivery
  failed?"). OAE adopts `X-OAE-Event`, `X-OAE-Delivery`, and a
  `openagentemail-webhooks/1` user agent (§7.1).
- **A 10-second response timeout.** GitHub documents that the endpoint *"should respond
  with a 2XX response within 10 seconds"*, after which GitHub terminates the connection
  and counts the delivery as failed. This is the one hard number GitHub publishes, and it
  independently validates the `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000` default proposed in
  §10.1 — which also happens to match this repo's existing `CIMD_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **A `ping` handshake at subscription creation.** GitHub documents that the `ping` event
  *"occurs when you create a new webhook"* as *"a confirmation … that you configured the
  webhook correctly"*, carrying a `zen` aphorism, `hook_id`, and the hook object. For a
  self-hosted product whose operators configure this over SSH, that feedback loop is worth
  more than it is for GitHub. Adopted as `webhook.ping` (§5.1, §10.3). Note that GitHub
  does **not** document whether the ping is delivered synchronously with the creation
  call, so this RFC treats synchronicity as its own open decision (§16, Q12) rather than
  copying GitHub.
- **A manual redelivery affordance backed by a stored delivery log.** GitHub lets you
  replay a delivery from the past **3 days**, through the UI or
  `POST …/hooks/{hook_id}/deliveries/{delivery_id}/attempts`. This is the cheapest
  possible dead-letter UX and maps directly onto the `notification-log.jsonl` pattern OAE
  already has. Adopted as `POST /v1/webhooks/deliveries/:id/redeliver` (§10.3), with the
  same 30-day retention as the rest of the repo's logs.
- **An algorithm-prefixed signature value.** GitHub's `X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>`
  makes the algorithm explicit on the wire, so a future algorithm is a new header/prefix
  rather than an ambiguity. Adopted as the `v1=` prefix (§7.2).

**Refuse:**

- **GitHub's absence of automatic retry.** This is the sharpest divergence in the whole
  comparison, and it is the opposite of what most people assume. GitHub documents
  plainly: *"GitHub does not automatically redeliver failed deliveries."* The retry loop
  is the **integrator's** problem — GitHub's own suggested automation is a user-authored
  cron GitHub Action that walks recent deliveries and re-posts them. That is a defensible
  choice for a platform with a built-in scheduler sitting next to every consumer, and it
  is indefensible for OAE, whose consumers are fifty-line scripts and serverless functions
  (#109's own framing). A failed delivery that nobody retries is a silently dropped mail
  event, which is exactly what #109 forbids. **OAE retries automatically** (§8.3) *and*
  offers manual redelivery.
- **Fat payloads.** GitHub sends the whole resource — a `push` event can carry hundreds of
  commits. That works because GitHub's consumers are CI systems with fat pipes and because
  GitHub owns both ends of the trust relationship. OAE's payload crosses to a third party
  and may contain mail metadata, so bounding is structural (§6.5), not best-effort.
- **Repository-scoped, UI-first management.** OAE has no per-repo concept and, per §2.2,
  no new UI in v1.

**Not usable as precedent:** GitHub publishes **no** statement about delivery ordering,
at-least-once semantics, or duplicates — the ordering disclaimer in §8.4 rests on Stripe,
not GitHub. GitHub also publishes no numeric retry budget (there is none) and no secret
rotation procedure; what it *does* do is emit a legacy `X-Hub-Signature` (HMAC-SHA1)
alongside `X-Hub-Signature-256` for algorithm migration, which is dual-*algorithm*
emission rather than dual-*secret*, and is discussed in §12.2 as the weaker cousin of the
mechanism OAE adopts.

### 4.2 Stripe webhooks

**Borrow — this is the most influential reference:**

- **Bind the timestamp into the signature.** Stripe signs `"<t>.<raw body>"` — the docs
  describe the signed payload as the concatenation of the timestamp as a string, a period,
  and the JSON payload — and puts `t=<unix seconds>` in `Stripe-Signature`. Consumers are
  told to reject deliveries whose timestamp is outside a tolerance window; the **client
  libraries' default is 5 minutes**, and it is a parameter the consumer passes, not a
  server-enforced limit. This makes replay protection a property of the *signature* rather
  than of a server-side nonce store — which matters enormously here, because OAE has no
  database to keep nonces in. Adopted in shape (§7.2, §7.4), with the important difference
  that OAE's tolerance is an operator setting that is *published to consumers*
  (`WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC`, surfaced in `GET /v1/webhooks`) rather than a library
  default each integrator must guess.
- **A thin envelope with a typed `data` object.** Stripe's Event object — `id`, `object`,
  `api_version`, `created`, `type`, `data.object`, `livemode`, `pending_webhooks`,
  `request` — is versioned, self-describing, and stable across event types. Adopted, with
  the fields OAE actually needs (§6.1).
- **Treat the payload as a snapshot and re-fetch authoritative state through the API.**
  Stripe documents this explicitly: consumers should *"retrieve the API resource from the
  Stripe API to access the latest and up-to-date object definition."* It is the decision
  that makes everything else cheap. If the webhook only has to be *good enough to act on*,
  the payload can stay small, the content-exposure question collapses (§6.5), and OAE never
  has to design a webhook-side representation of a mail body. The consumer fetches
  `GET /v1/messages/:id` with its own credentials. Adopted as a hard rule.
  **Consequence worth stating plainly: possession of a webhook signing secret is not a
  mail-content credential.** Full content still requires an API token.
- **Dedupe on the event id, as documented consumer guidance.** Stripe's own words: guard
  against duplicates *"by logging the event IDs you've processed, and then not processing
  already-logged events."* Adopted verbatim as a normative consumer requirement (§8.1).
- **Multiple signatures in one header during a secret roll.** Stripe confirms it: *"You can
  have multiple signatures with the same scheme-secret pair when you roll an endpoint's
  secret… Stripe generates one signature for each secret."* The header also carries a
  legacy `v0=` field next to `v1=`, which is living proof that a versioned prefix lets an
  old scheme coexist with a new one for years. Adopted for rotation (§12.2) and for
  algorithm versioning (§7.6).
- **`pending_webhooks` as a failure counter.** Stripe's Event object carries the number of
  webhooks not yet successfully delivered. It is a small, cheap, always-visible signal that
  the push subsystem is behind — precisely the "fail visible" property #109 asks for.
  Adopted in spirit as per-endpoint `consecutiveFailures` and instance-level dead-letter
  counts (§13).
- **An explicit ordering disclaimer.** *"Stripe doesn't guarantee the delivery of events in
  the order that they're generated."* One sentence, prominently documented, and it removes
  an entire class of integrator bug. Adopted, plus the reconstruction tools Stripe does not
  offer (§8.4).
- **The three-day retry horizon.** Stripe retries *"for up to three days with an exponential
  back off in live mode"*. This RFC's first draft **refused** this and recommended ~27 hours,
  arguing that mail is perishable and that a JSONL file is a poor three-day queue. Decision
  **D2** (§17) overrode that and adopted the three-day horizon to align with Stripe and
  SendGrid, so it belongs in this column rather than the one below. What survives of the
  original argument is recorded rather than quietly deleted, because it still constrains the
  design: the perishability objection is answered by **front-loading** (four attempts inside
  35 minutes, §8.3), and the queue-cost objection is carried into §8.6 as a real constraint
  on the durable log. What is *not* borrowed is Stripe's opacity — Stripe publishes no
  attempt count, so §8.3 enumerates all eleven offsets explicitly.

**Refuse:**

- **`api_version` pinning per endpoint.** Stripe's per-account API version pinning is a
  large compatibility machine justified by thousands of breaking-change-averse
  integrations. OAE has one payload version and additive-only evolution rules (§5.3).
- **A database-backed event log.** Stripe can inspect and replay from durable storage at
  scale. OAE keeps a bounded 30-day JSONL and says so (§8.6).

**Not usable as precedent:** Stripe publishes no numeric response timeout — it says the
endpoint must return 2xx *"quickly … before any complex logic that could cause a timeout"*
— so §8.2's timeout comes from GitHub's 10 s and this repo's own `CIMD_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`,
not from Stripe. Stripe also does **not** document automatic disablement of failing
endpoints; that behavior is Resend's (§4.3), and attributing it to Stripe would be wrong.

### 4.3 Resend / Svix, and SendGrid

Resend is the closest *domain* analogue — a thin event catalog around email, including an
`email.received` type — and it delegates signing to Svix. SendGrid is examined twice,
because it signs one webhook and not the other, and the contrast is instructive.

**Borrow:**

- **Resend's published retry schedule, almost verbatim.** Resend's *Retries and replays*
  page enumerates its attempts exactly: *"Immediately, 5 seconds, 5 minutes, 30 minutes,
  2 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours (in addition to the previous)"* — eight attempts.
  This is the single most useful number set in the comparison, because it is (a) published
  rather than vague, (b) bounded rather than open-ended, and (c) derived for **email
  events**, the same domain. OAE adopts this shape in §8.3 and credits it.

  **Worth recording: Resend's own docs disagree with themselves.** Its dashboard webhooks
  introduction page lists only *"5 seconds, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 5 hours,
  10 hours"* — six delays, no leading immediate attempt and no trailing second 10 hours.
  Neither page states whether its numbers are inter-attempt delays or offsets from the
  first, which changes the total span by hours. This is not a dig at Resend; it is the
  reason §8.3 specifies OAE's schedule as explicit delays with a computed worst-case span,
  rather than inheriting a list that even a well-run vendor documents two ways.
- **Resend's documented auto-disablement.** *"If the endpoint continues to fail, Resend
  will eventually disable it automatically and send a second notification to let you
  know."* Disablement **plus an explicit second notification** is the complete form of
  "fail visible, never silent". Adopted as the circuit breaker (§8.5), with OAE's
  notification riding the existing ntfy urgent path where available.
- **Svix's multi-signature rotation header.** The Standard Webhooks specification defines
  `webhook-id` / `webhook-timestamp` / `webhook-signature`, and Svix-hosted senders —
  Resend included — emit the same triple as `svix-id` / `svix-timestamp` /
  `svix-signature`. The signature value is `v1,<base64>`, and the header is a
  **space-delimited list** of signatures specifically to support *"zero downtime secret
  rotation"*: during an overlap the delivery carries both `v1,<new>` and `v1,<old>`, so a
  consumer migrates without a coordinated cutover and without a dropped event. This is the
  strongest rotation precedent of the four vendors. Adopted (§7.1, §12.2).
- **Resend's thin envelope and thin catalog as sanity checks.** Resend's payload is
  `type` / `created_at` / `data` — thinner than Stripe's — and its whole catalog is **19
  event types**, of which **11** are in the `email.*` namespace. That is direct evidence
  from a mature commercial email product that a one-event v1 (§5.1) is not embarrassingly
  small, and that a wide catalog is a liability rather than a feature. Resend also has an
  `email.received`, which validates OAE's choice of `mail.received` as the starting point.
- **Manual replay of both outcomes.** Resend documents that *"You can replay both `failed`
  and `succeeded` webhook messages."* Replaying a *successful* delivery is a small idea
  worth stealing: it is how an integrator tests their handler against a real payload
  without waiting for real mail. OAE's equivalent is
  `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries` plus `POST /v1/webhooks/deliveries/:id/redeliver`
  (§10.3), and §16 Q15 asks whether redelivery of succeeded events should be in v1.
  Stale / unknown delivery-list cursors on `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries` return
  **HTTP 400 `{error:"invalid_cursor"}`** rather than silently rewinding to page 1 (#216).

**Refuse:**

- **Svix's binding of the delivery id into the signed string.** Svix signs
  `<id>.<timestamp>.<payload>`. That is necessary for Svix because its message id lives
  only in a header, so an unbound signature could be replayed across deliveries that share
  a timestamp and body. OAE's event `id` is **already inside the signed body** (§6.1), so
  binding it again in the signed string would add nothing; only the timestamp needs
  binding, which is Stripe's shape and what §7.2 adopts. Recorded here because "copy Svix
  exactly" is the obvious suggestion and it is redundant for this payload layout.
- **Svix's base64 signature encoding.** Noted and deliberately declined in §7.2, which
  chooses hex for integrator familiarity. Recorded as an open question (§16, Q13) because
  it is a genuine trade rather than a clear win.
- **Delegating delivery to an external service.** Svix is a vendor. OAE is self-hosted by
  definition (#109: *"self-hosted OAE instances run on public servers by definition"*);
  adding a required third party in the delivery path would invert the product's premise and
  add a trust root the operator does not control.
- **`multipart/form-data` with raw MIME (SendGrid inbound parse).** SendGrid posts the
  parsed message as form data, with an option to post the raw MIME instead. Two refusals:
  JSON is the right body for a metadata-first event, and — see the next point — inbound
  parse is **unsigned**.
- **Unsigned delivery (SendGrid inbound parse).** SendGrid's inbound-parse documentation
  contains no signature, HMAC, or signature header at all; the only trust mechanism is that
  you control the hostname and its MX record, and the URL must be *"accessible from the
  internet"*. That is secrecy-by-obscurity on a public endpoint. #109 states HMAC signing
  is mandatory, and this RFC keeps it mandatory with no unsigned mode (§7).

  **The instructive part is that SendGrid contradicts itself.** Its *outbound* Event
  Webhook **is** signed — with **ECDSA**, via `X-Twilio-Email-Event-Webhook-Signature` and
  `X-Twilio-Email-Event-Webhook-Timestamp`, over a SHA-256 hash of timestamp + raw payload
  bytes. So the same vendor signs its event webhook asymmetrically and leaves its
  inbound-parse webhook unsigned. Two takeaways: unsigned push is a corner-cut, not a
  design position; and **asymmetric webhook signing is already shipping in production at a
  major vendor**, which is the concrete precedent behind §7.6's claim that an Ed25519 `v2=`
  scheme for #59 is additive rather than exotic.
- **Silent discard.** SendGrid retries POSTs that respond with **5XX**, and states that
  messages undeliverable after **3 days** *"will be dropped"* and that *"SendGrid will not
  send a notification before the message is dropped."* Irreversible data loss with no
  signal is the exact failure mode #109 forbids. (SendGrid's docs are internally ambiguous
  about whether a 4XX enters the 3-day retry loop or is dropped immediately; OAE resolves
  this explicitly in §8.2 rather than leaving it undefined.) OAE dead-letters into an
  inspectable log and raises a health signal instead (§8.5, §8.6, §13).

### 4.4 Summary

| Dimension | GitHub | Stripe | Resend / Svix | SendGrid inbound parse | **OAE v1** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signature | `X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>` over raw body | `Stripe-Signature: t=,v1=<hex>` over `t.body` | `svix-signature: v1,<base64>` over `id.ts.body` | **none** | `X-OAE-Signature: t=,v1=<hex>` over `t.body` |
| Replay defense | none intrinsic | timestamp tolerance (5 min library default) | timestamp tolerance | URL secrecy | timestamp tolerance + `id` dedupe |
| Response timeout | **10 s (published)** | not published ("quickly") | not published | not published | **10 s** |
| Payload | full resource | snapshot + refetch | thin `type`/`created_at`/`data` | raw MIME / form data | **bounded metadata + refetch** |
| Auto-retry | **none** | ~3 days, exponential, live mode; attempt count unpublished | **8 delays published (docs list 6 elsewhere)** | 3 days on 5XX, then drop | **11 attempts / exactly 72 h, all offsets published** |
| Manual redelivery | yes, 3-day window | via dashboard | yes; failed **and** succeeded | no | **yes, 30-day log** |
| Ordering | not documented | **explicitly not guaranteed** | not guaranteed (spec) | n/a | **not guaranteed, cursor provided** |
| Rotation | undocumented; dual-emits SHA-1 + SHA-256 | **multiple `v1=` during secret roll** | **space-delimited multi-sig overlap** | n/a | **multi-sig overlap window** |
| Failure visibility | delivery log only | `pending_webhooks` counter | **auto-disable + second notification** | **silent drop, explicitly no notification** | **log + disable + notify + audit** |

The design is Stripe's envelope, timestamp-binding, refetch, and ordering-disclaimer
discipline; Resend's published retry schedule and auto-disable-plus-notify behavior;
Svix's multi-signature rotation; GitHub's operational affordances (typed headers, ping,
manual redelivery) and its 10-second timeout; and OAE's own payload-bounding and SSRF
machinery. The two deliberate divergences from all four vendors are **automatic retry**
(where GitHub does nothing and SendGrid drops silently) and **structural payload bounding**
(where only Resend is comparably thin, and none of them bound by policy rather than by
taste).

## 5. Event catalog

### 5.1 v1 catalog

Two domain event types are emitted in v1, plus the operational `webhook.ping`. Decision
**D1** (§17) expanded this from one type to two:

| Type | Trigger | Emitted from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mail.received` | a new message becomes visible in the catch-all inbox and is attributable to at least one identity | the inbound-mail event loop (§11.4), once per new UID |
| `approval.requested` | an approval task is created and enters `input-required` | `createApprovalTask()` (`tasks-internal.ts:1524`), after the task is durably written |
| `webhook.ping` | operator requests endpoint validation | `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test`, and asynchronously at creation (§10.3) |

The two domain types have **different emission sites**, and that is the single largest
implementation consequence of D1: `mail.received` comes off the IMAP inbound loop while
`approval.requested` comes off the task-creation path. §11.4's event bus must therefore span
both, which is a bigger refactor than the mail-only version this document originally scoped.
§15 sequences it accordingly.

`webhook.ping` is not a domain event; it carries no mail or task data and exists only to
prove reachability and signature correctness. It is delivered with the same signing, retry,
and logging machinery, but with a reduced retry budget (§8.3) — there is no point retrying a
connectivity test for three days. Per decision **D12** (§17) the ping at creation is fired
**asynchronously**, and the endpoint starts in state `unverified` until one succeeds
(§8.5), so create latency is never coupled to a third party.

**The ordering consequence, stated explicitly because it looks like a bug and is not.** The
`201` response is the *first* moment the operator possesses the signing secret (§12.3), and the
creation ping is fired asynchronously — so the ping can easily reach the consumer **before**
the operator has copied that secret into the consumer's config, and will then fail signature
verification on the consumer side. That is expected and benign:

- The ping is **retried** on the §8.3 schedule (attempts 1–3, ~5 minutes), so a later attempt
  normally lands after configuration is complete.
- A failed creation ping does **not** disable the endpoint. Only `refused` disables immediately
  (§8.5); a consumer rejecting the signature typically returns `401`/`400`, i.e. `permanent`,
  and a `permanent` outcome on a **ping** is deliberately not counted toward the circuit
  breaker — precisely because this race is routine. Real events are unaffected.
- `unverified` is advisory (§8.5), so delivery is not gated on the ping succeeding.
- `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test` is the intended way to re-check on demand once configuration is
  done, and reaching `enabled` deliberately rather than by race.

The alternative — withholding the ping until the operator confirms the secret is configured —
would need a confirmation step that does not exist and would reintroduce the create-latency
coupling D12 removed. An operator who wants a verified-first flow configures the consumer,
then calls `/test`, and ignores the creation ping.

**`webhook.ping` payload.** The envelope (§6.1) always carries a `data` object with an
`object` discriminator, and ping is no exception — an empty or omitted `data` would force
consumers to special-case the one type that has no fields. It carries the minimum needed to
act on it:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_5a9c1e73-2b84-4d06-9f31-8c7e2a40b1d6",
  "type": "webhook.ping",
  "payloadVersion": "v1",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-03T12:20:01.104Z",
  "domain": "openagent.email",
  "data": {
    "object": "webhook",
    "webhookId": "whk_4a1b8c2d-5e6f-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d",
    "trigger": "creation"
  }
}
```

`trigger` is `"creation"` (fired asynchronously by `POST /v1/webhooks`, per D12) or `"test"`
(fired by `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test`). `webhookId` lets a consumer that hosts several
subscriptions on one URL tell which one is being validated — without it, a ping against a
shared endpoint is unattributable. There is deliberately **no** `address`, `secret`, or
`secretPrefix`: a ping proves reachability and signature correctness, and carrying the address
would make it a way to enumerate which mailboxes an endpoint is subscribed to from anyone who
can trigger a test.

**Emission granularity.**

- `mail.received`: one event per **(message, address)** pair, not one per message. A message
  delivered to two identities on the instance produces two events, each scoped to one
  address, because subscriptions are address-scoped (§10.4) and a consumer must never
  receive metadata about a mailbox it did not subscribe to. This mirrors how
  `messageAccessibleToAddress()` already scopes reads.
- `approval.requested`: **one event per approval task, with no fan-out**, matched to
  subscriptions on the `reviewer` address — which in v1 is **always the task's `to`**, since
  `createApprovalTask()` hardcodes `reviewer: to` and rejects any snapshot where they differ
  (§6.3). Exactly one address is the reviewer, so exactly one event is emitted. Both parties
  are required to be managed identities on the instance (`tasks-internal.ts:1529`), so there
  is no off-instance case to handle.

### 5.2 Reserved names

These are reserved so that emitting them later is additive and cannot collide. Reserving
a name costs nothing and prevents a future breaking rename.

| Reserved type | Future trigger | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mail.sent` | a message leaves via `POST /v1/send` | needs a send-path hook, not the IMAP loop |
| `task.created` / `task.updated` / `task.completed` / `task.failed` | task state events | the task state machine already writes stamped events to IMAP threads |
| `approval.decided` | a reviewer approves or rejects | clean emitter exists: `decideApprovalTask()` (`tasks-internal.ts:2440`). Not blocked, just not requested for v1 |
| `approval.expired` | an approval passes its deadline | **blocked on a missing emitter** — expiry is materialized lazily on read with no scheduler (§2.2). Needs a reaper. Deferred to v1.1 |
| `task.lease.claimed` / `renewed` / `released` / `expired` | lease lifecycle | gated on `TASK_LEASES_ENABLED` |

`approval.requested` was reserved in the first draft of this RFC and **D1 promoted it into
v1** (§17), because #109 names it as the highest-value human-in-the-loop case: pushing
"an approval needs you" to ntfy or Telegram the moment it happens, instead of leaving it to
be discovered by a poll. The cost the owner accepted in doing so is written down in §2.2 and
§11.4 — the event bus must span the task path, not only the mail path — and the part that
could not be pulled forward is `approval.expired`, which has no emitter to hook because
nothing observes expiry until someone reads the task. Shipping two of the three approval
events is a deliberate asymmetry, not an oversight: `requested` and `decided` are both
caused by an API call, while `expired` is caused by a clock, and this codebase has no clock
sweep over tasks.

### 5.3 Catalog evolution rules

1. Type names are `domain.action`, lower-case, dot-separated, and **both segments are
   single words**: no underscores, no hyphens, no camelCase. Resend's catalog contains
   `email.delivery_delayed` alongside `email.delivered` and `email.bounced` (§4.3) — an
   underscore inside a dot-separated namespace, in a mature commercial product. It is a
   small thing that cannot be undone once integrators have string-matched on it, so the
   rule is written down before the second event type exists rather than after. Reserved
   names in §5.2 already comply; if a future action genuinely needs two words, it gets two
   dots (`task.lease.claimed`) rather than an underscore.
2. **New types are always additive.** Emitting a type that did not exist before is never a
   breaking change, given rule 3.
3. **Consumers must ignore event types they do not recognize.** This is a normative
   requirement on consumers, documented prominently, and it is what makes §5.2 safe.
4. Fields may be added to `data` at any time. Fields may not be removed, renamed, or
   change type within a payload version; that requires a new payload version (§7.6).
5. A subscription declares the types it wants. An unrecognized type in a subscription
   request is rejected at creation (`400 {error:'unknown_event_type'}`) rather than
   silently stored — otherwise a typo produces a subscription that never fires, which is
   the worst possible failure mode for a push system. The set of acceptable types is
   itself versioned, so this check loosens as the catalog grows.

## 6. Payload schema

### 6.1 Envelope

Every delivery body is a single JSON object:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | `evt_` + UUIDv4. Globally unique per event. **The consumer's dedupe key.** The same `id` may be delivered more than once (§8.1). |
| `type` | string | Event type (§5). |
| `payloadVersion` | string | `"v1"`. Bumped only on a breaking change (§7.6). |
| `createdAt` | string | RFC 3339 UTC, millisecond precision. When OAE created the event, *not* when the mail arrived. |
| `domain` | string | The emitting instance's `config.domain`. Lets one consumer disambiguate multiple OAE instances. |
| `data` | object | Type-specific payload (§6.2). |

Event ids follow the repository's existing UUID convention (`lib/task-id.ts` validates
UUID v1–5) rather than introducing a sortable-id scheme. Sortability is deliberately not
relied upon: ordering is reconstructed from `data.receivedAt` and `data.uid` (§8.4), not
from the event id and not from the opaque cursor. Whether to move to UUIDv7/ULID is
§16, Q13.

### 6.2 `mail.received` data object

| Field | Type | Scope | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `object` | `"mail"` | metadata | Stripe-style discriminator, so `data` is self-describing. |
| `address` | string | metadata | The mailbox this event is scoped to. Always a single address (§5.1). |
| `messageId` | string | metadata | OAE message id — a **decimal IMAP UID as a string**, not a UUID (`toDetail()` emits `String(uid)`; `getMessageWith()` parses the parameter as a positive integer, `imap.ts:903-905`). Usable against `GET /v1/messages/:id` **only together with `uidValidity`** — see the warning below. |
| `cursor` | string | metadata | Signed `mail-cursor-v1` token (§3.7). **Opaque — never string-compare or sort on it** (§8.4). A resume token to hand back to the list API once `GET /v1/messages` accepts one (§3.7, §15). |
| `uid` | integer | metadata | The IMAP UID as a number. With `receivedAt`, the **supported ordering key** (§8.4). |
| `uidValidity` | integer | metadata | The mailbox generation that produced `uid` and `messageId`. UIDs from different `uidValidity` values are not comparable. |
| `receivedAt` | string | metadata | RFC 3339 UTC arrival time. |
| `from` | `{address, name}` | metadata | Sender. |
| `to` | `string[]` | metadata | Recipient addresses as delivered. |
| `cc` | `string[]` | metadata | CC addresses as delivered. |
| `subject` | string | metadata | **Truncated** to `WEBHOOK_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES`. |
| `sizeBytes` | integer | metadata | RFC822 size. |
| `hasAttachments` | boolean | metadata | Attachment presence, not content. |
| `unread` | boolean | metadata | `\Seen` flag state at emission. |
| `containsSecurityCode` | boolean | metadata | An OTP/verification code was detected. **Presence only, never the value** at this scope. |
| `containsLink` | boolean | metadata | A verification-style link was detected. Presence only. |
| `textPreview` | string | `preview` | Body preview, ≤ `WEBHOOK_BODY_PREVIEW_CHARS`. |
| `securityCodes` | `string[]` | `preview` | ≤ `WEBHOOK_MAX_CODE_ITEMS` entries, each ≤ `WEBHOOK_CODE_ENTRY_CHARS`. |
| `links` | `string[]` | `preview` | ≤ `WEBHOOK_MAX_CODE_ITEMS` entries. **An over-long link is dropped whole, never truncated** — see the note below. |

**Links are dropped whole, never truncated.** `securityCodes` are truncated at
`WEBHOOK_CODE_ENTRY_CHARS` because a partial code is at worst useless, but a URL truncated at
200 characters is actively harmful: verification and signed links routinely exceed that, and
a consumer that fetches a truncated URL gets a 404 or — worse — a valid response for a
*different* resource whose signature happens to verify against the truncated path. The repo
already settled this question for push notifications: `packPushLinkLines()` is documented as
*"Never mid-truncates a URL; drops the tail and appends a +N note"*
(`notification-watcher.ts:266-268`). Webhooks follow the same rule — a link over
`WEBHOOK_CODE_ENTRY_CHARS` is omitted entirely and counted in the dropped tally, and
`containsLink` (§6.2) remains `true` so the consumer still knows to fetch the message and look
for itself. Truncating codes but not links is a deliberate asymmetry, not an oversight.

The `containsSecurityCode` / `containsLink` booleans at metadata scope are a direct lift
from push tier 1, which already communicates *"(contains OTP or verification link)"*
without the value. They are the most valuable two bytes in the payload for the flagship
use case in #109 — waking a postmaster agent only for mail that actually needs action —
and they leak almost nothing.

**`messageId` alone is not a safe refetch key, and the API has to change for it to become
one.** The refetch pattern this RFC adopts from Stripe (§4.2) says: act on the event, then
fetch authoritative content via `GET /v1/messages/:id`. But `getMessageWith()` validates only
that the id parses to a positive integer and then calls `fetchOne(uid, …)`
(`imap.ts:898-909`) — and `lib/imap.ts` contains **no reference to `uidValidity` at all**. A
UID is unique only within a mailbox generation, and D2's retry horizon means a delivery can
legitimately arrive **up to 72 hours** after emission. An INBOX rebuilt in that window
restarts UIDs from scratch, so the consumer's refetch would return a *different, unrelated*
message with a `200` and no indication anything was wrong. For a webhook whose whole purpose
is waking an agent to act on mail, silently acting on the wrong mail is the worst available
failure mode.

So PR 3 (§15) must add a generation precondition to the detail route, not merely a forward
cursor:

> `GET /v1/messages/:id` accepts an optional `uidValidity` integer query parameter. When
> supplied and it does not match the mailbox's current generation, the route returns
> **`404 {error:'stale_message_generation'}`** — never a different message. Webhook consumers
> MUST pass `data.uidValidity` from the event when refetching; the payload carries it (§6.2)
> for exactly this reason.

The parameter is optional so existing callers are unaffected, but the webhook documentation
states it as mandatory for event-driven refetch, and §14 tests the mismatch path. Without it
the `uidValidity` field in the payload is decorative.

### 6.3 `approval.requested` data object

Added to v1 by decision **D1** (§17). Fields derive from `ApprovalSnapshot`
(`tasks-internal.ts:76-81`), which is exactly `{action, reviewer, expiresAt, digest}`, and
from the approval digest rules already documented normatively in `docs/approval-digest.md`.

| Field | Type | Scope | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `object` | `"approval"` | metadata | Discriminator, so `data` stays self-describing across event types. |
| `taskId` | string | metadata | UUID. Usable directly against `GET /v1/tasks/:id`. |
| `taskState` | `"input-required"` | metadata | Approvals are created in this state (`tasks-internal.ts:1556`); always literal at emission. |
| `from` | string | metadata | Requesting address. Always a managed identity on this instance (§6.3 note). |
| `to` | string | metadata | Task assignee — and, in v1, **the reviewer**. Always a managed identity, and never equal to `from`. |
| `reviewer` | string | metadata | **The party who must act.** Subscription matching key. In v1 this is **always byte-identical to `to`** — see the note below. Carried as its own field because it is the semantically correct matching key and because `ApprovalSnapshot` already names it (`tasks-internal.ts:78`). |
| `subject` | string | metadata | Truncated to `WEBHOOK_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES`. |
| `createdAt` | string | metadata | RFC 3339 UTC task creation time. |
| `expiresAt` | string | metadata | RFC 3339 UTC approval deadline, from the snapshot. |
| `expiresInSec` | integer \| `null` | metadata | `expiresAt - createdAt` in whole seconds, **computed at emission from the same clock reading used for `createdAt`**, not derived later from stored fields. Always ≤ 2592000, since `assertApprovalExpiryBound()` (`tasks-internal.ts:446`) enforces `APPROVAL_MAX_LIFETIME_MS` = 30 days (`:101`). Never negative: that validator only requires the deadline to be later than the moment validation *begins*, while `createApprovalTask()` performs the durable mail write before assigning `createdAt` (`tasks-internal.ts:1550`), so a sub-second deadline can round to `0` and a slow write can make the difference negative. Emission therefore **clamps to `0`, and emits `null` if the deadline has already passed** — a `null` is an explicit "already expired at emission" signal, which is more honest than publishing `0` or a negative number. Whether to instead enforce a minimum approval lifetime at creation is §16 Q19. |
| `digest` | string | metadata | Lower-case hex SHA-256 of the canonical action JSON (`approvalActionDigest()`, `tasks-internal.ts:442`). 64 characters. |
| `actionType` | string | metadata | `action.type` — a non-empty string per `docs/approval-digest.md`. |
| `actionName` | string | metadata | `action.name` — a non-empty string, truncated to `WEBHOOK_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES`. |
| `actionArguments` | **any JSON value** | `preview` | The action's `arguments`, bounded by `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_BYTES` and `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_DEPTH`. |

**`actionArguments` is any JSON value, not an object.** The task API declares `arguments` as
`z.unknown()`, and `docs/approval-digest.md` specifies it as "any JSON value" — so valid
existing approvals carry an array, a string, a number, a boolean, or `null`. Typing the
webhook field as an object would make those approvals unrepresentable: either the payload
violates its own schema or the field is silently dropped, losing the reviewer's only view of
what is being asked. Non-object values are bounded by serializing them and applying the same
byte cap; a string or array over the cap is **dropped whole** rather than truncated, per §6.6,
because a fragment of a JSON value is worse than none and the `digest` still lets the consumer
verify what it fetches.

**Why `actionType` and `actionName` are metadata but `arguments` is not.** A human-in-the-loop
push is useless if the reviewer cannot tell *what* is being asked — "approve `send_email` /
`notify-owner`?" is the entire decision to wake up for, and both fields are short
non-empty strings. `arguments` is arbitrary JSON up to 64 KiB at depth 10
(`tasks-internal.ts:99-100`) and can contain mail content, credentials, or anything else a
caller put there, so it is gated exactly like a mail body (§6.5) and requires admin.

**The digest makes the refetch pattern verifiable, which is stronger than for mail.** For
`mail.received`, re-fetching gives current state and the consumer must trust it. For
`approval.requested`, the consumer can recompute `approvalActionDigest()` over the action it
fetches from `GET /v1/tasks/:id` and compare with the announced `digest`: a match proves the
action it is about to approve is byte-identical to the one announced. The canonicalization
rules are already written down normatively for third-party implementers, with committed
interop vectors verified by an independent Python implementation — so a non-JavaScript
consumer can do this. That is a real security property, and it is free.

**Subscription matching for approval events — and a correction.** An `approval.requested`
event is delivered to subscriptions whose `address` equals **`reviewer`**. That is the
semantically correct key, and it is what `ApprovalSnapshot` calls it.

But an earlier draft of this section described `reviewer` and `to` as *different* parties and
instructed that matching must use `reviewer` "**not** `from` or `to`". That is false against
the code, and implementing it literally would have suppressed **every** approval webhook:

- `createApprovalTask()` builds the snapshot as
  `{ action, reviewer: to, expiresAt, digest }` (`tasks-internal.ts:1535`). There is no
  independent reviewer input — `CreateApprovalTaskInput` (`:257-266`) has only `from`, `to`,
  `subject`, `body`, `action`, `expiresAt`, and `parentTaskId`.
- The reconstruction path *enforces* the identity: a parsed snapshot with
  `snapshot.reviewer !== to` is rejected outright (`:992`), as is `reviewer === from` (`:993`).
- `from === to` throws `approval_participants_must_differ` (`:1528`).

So in v1 **the assignee is the reviewer**, always. Matching on `reviewer` and matching on `to`
are the same operation, and the field is kept separate only so the payload names the right
concept and so a future independent reviewer is an additive change rather than a rename. The
example in §6.4 accordingly uses one address for both.

Two further corrections that follow from the same reading:

- **The off-instance case cannot arise.** An earlier draft said "if the reviewer is not an
  address on this instance, no event is emitted". `createApprovalTask()` throws
  `approval_identity_required` unless **both** `from` and `to` are known managed identities
  (`:1529`), so every approval task already has an on-instance reviewer by construction. The
  fail-closed rule is still worth stating for the reconstruction path, but it is not a live
  branch at creation.
- **There is no fan-out**, and now for a precise reason: exactly one address is the reviewer,
  so exactly one event is emitted. This differs from `mail.received` (§5.1), which fans out
  per recipient because several mailboxes legitimately own one message.

The practical consequence for #109's human-in-the-loop case is worth stating plainly, because
it constrains the feature: **v1 cannot page a reviewer who is not the task's assignee.** An
agent that wants a human paged must create the approval *addressed to the human*. Routing an
approval to one party while paging another needs a real `reviewer` input on
`CreateApprovalTaskInput`, which is a task-API change outside this RFC's scope and is
§16 Q20.

**Emission site.** `createApprovalTask()` (`tasks-internal.ts:1524`), after the task is
durably written. This is **not** the IMAP inbound-mail loop, which is the ripple D1 causes
for §11.4 and §15: the event bus must span the task path as well as the mail path.

### 6.4 Example delivery

Request:

```http
POST /hooks/oae HTTP/1.1
Host: consumer.example.com

  "createdAt": "2026-09-03T12:26:40.412Z",
  "domain": "openagent.email",
  "data": {
    "object": "mail",
    "address": "postmaster@openagent.email",
    "messageId": "4821",
    "cursor": "mail-cursor-v1.Zm9sZGVy… (opaque — never sort on this)",
    "uid": 4821,
    "uidValidity": 17,
    "receivedAt": "2026-09-03T12:26:39.000Z",

    "hasAttachments": false,
    "unread": true,

  }
}
```

The same delivery with `contentScope: "preview"` adds:

```json
{
  "textPreview": "Use code 483920 to complete your verification. This code expires in 10 minutes…",
  "securityCodes": ["483920"],
  "links": []
}
```

An `approval.requested` delivery at `metadata` scope (§6.3):

```json
{
  "id": "evt_7c4d9f02-1a6b-4e83-9c25-4f0a7b1e6d38",
  "type": "approval.requested",
  "payloadVersion": "v1",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-03T12:31:07.884Z",
  "domain": "openagent.email",
  "data": {
    "object": "approval",
    "taskId": "3f8a1c62-9d4e-4b07-a5f1-6c2e8d904b73",
    "taskState": "input-required",
    "from": "researcher@openagent.email",
    "to": "owner@openagent.email",
    "reviewer": "owner@openagent.email",
    "subject": "Approve outbound send to press@example.com",
    "createdAt": "2026-09-03T12:31:07.512Z",
    "expiresAt": "2026-09-04T12:31:07.512Z",
    "expiresInSec": 86400,
    "digest": "9f2c4a71b8e03d56f1a9c24e7b03d8f6a1c94e27b05d83f6a1c49e27b0d83f6a",
    "actionType": "tool_call",
    "actionName": "send_email"
  }
}
```

At `preview` scope this adds `actionArguments`, bounded by
`WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_BYTES` and `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_DEPTH` — and the consumer
can verify what it fetches from `GET /v1/tasks/:id` against `digest` before acting (§6.3).

Expected consumer response: any `2xx`. OAE reads at most
`WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES` of the response body and discards it; the response body has
no defined meaning and must not be relied upon by either side.

### 6.5 Content scope and bounding

Two scopes, per subscription:

| Scope | Who may set it | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata` (**default**) | admin or the address's own identity token | envelope + metadata fields only, for both event types |
| `preview` | **admin only** | metadata, plus `textPreview` / `securityCodes` / `links` for `mail.received` (§6.2) and `actionArguments` for `approval.requested` (§6.3) |

Three reasons the bounding is structural rather than a truncation pass:

1. **A webhook never carries a full mail body.** Even `preview` scope carries a bounded
   preview. Full content requires `GET /v1/messages/:id` with the consumer's own API
   credentials. This is Stripe's refetch pattern, and it means the signing secret is not
   a content credential (§4.2).
2. **`preview` is admin-only**, mirroring the existing rule that push tier 3 is set only
   by an admin (`setIdentityPushContentTier()`, `identities.ts:396`). A compromised
   identity token can therefore subscribe to metadata about its own mailbox — which it can
   already read via the API — but **cannot** open a content-exfiltration channel to an
   arbitrary external host. That distinction is the whole security argument for scopes.
3. **Bounds reuse the push-tier constants' shape, not their values.** The ntfy caps
   (3500 bytes total, 280-char preview) exist because a phone-push relay is the
   bottleneck. A webhook's bottleneck is OAE's own egress and the JSONL log, so the caps
   are relaxed but still explicit (§6.6). The *helpers* — `truncateUtf8Bytes()`,
   `boundPreviewChars()` — are reused so truncation stays UTF-8-safe.

**Deliberately not reused: `pushContentTier` itself.** Webhook scope is a separate
setting. Coupling them would mean that enabling webhooks for an agent changes what lands
on the owner's phone lock screen, and the two have genuinely different threat models —
ntfy traverses a third-party relay to a lock screen; a webhook goes to an HTTPS endpoint
the operator chose. Cross-wiring them would be a configuration footgun with a privacy
cost.

**Sensitive marking.** Deliveries at `preview` scope are marked `sensitive: true` in the
delivery log, following the tier-3 precedent (`notification-watcher.ts` sets
`sensitive` on log rows). Sensitive deliveries additionally never write any payload
fragment to the log (§8.6).

### 6.6 Size limits

| Constant | Proposed default | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | 16384 | 4× the ntfy cap; no relay bottleneck, but bounded so the delivery log and retry queue stay cheap. Trivially below `JSON_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` (16 MiB, `limits.ts:5`). |
| `WEBHOOK_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES` | 400 | Same as `PUSH_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES`; subjects are short and 400 bytes is generous. |
| `WEBHOOK_BODY_PREVIEW_CHARS` | 280 | Same as `PUSH_BODY_PREVIEW_CHARS`; a proven preview length. |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_CODE_ITEMS` | 5 | Same as `PUSH_OTP_ITEM_MAX`. |
| `WEBHOOK_CODE_ENTRY_CHARS` | 200 | Same as `PUSH_OTP_ENTRY_CHARS`. |
| `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_BYTES` | 4096 | Far below the 64 KiB the task API allows (`APPROVAL_ACTION_MAX_BYTES`, `tasks-internal.ts:99`). A reviewer deciding on a phone needs the gist; the full arguments are one `GET /v1/tasks/:id` away, and the `digest` proves they are the announced ones (§6.3). |
| `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_DEPTH` | 4 | Below the API's 10 (`APPROVAL_ACTION_MAX_DEPTH`). Deep nesting buys a reviewer nothing and costs payload. |
| `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES` | 4096 | Mirrors `CIMD_MAX_BYTES` (5 KiB) and `NTFY_REQUEST_MAX_BYTES`. OAE needs only the status code; an unbounded response read is an amplification vector. |

Overflow behavior: if a payload still exceeds `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` after field
truncation, the delivery proceeds with fields dropped in a **defined order**, never by
truncating mid-JSON. The order is specified **per event type**, because the two types carry
different fields and an approval payload must not be degraded by a rule written for mail —
review caught that the first draft's single mail-shaped order gave `approval.requested` no
usable degradation path at all, so a 4 KiB `actionArguments` under a lower configured
`WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` could fail delivery outright instead of shedding the field.

`mail.received`:

- `preview` scope: `links` → `securityCodes` → `textPreview`, then continue as below.
- both scopes: `cc` → `to` → `subject` → **`from.name`**.
- **never dropped:** `id`, `type`, `payloadVersion`, `createdAt`, `domain`, `data.object`,
  `data.address`, `data.messageId`, `data.cursor`, `data.uid`, `data.uidValidity`,
  `data.receivedAt`, `data.from.address`, the two `contains…` booleans, and the three
  fixed-size scalars `data.sizeBytes`, `data.hasAttachments`, `data.unread`. Every field in
  §6.2 is now accounted for: it is either in a drop order or in this set, with none left
  undefined. The three scalars are never dropped because they cost at most a few dozen bytes
  and `unread` in particular is what a postmaster agent routes on.

**Every field in a never-dropped set is itself byte-capped**, because "never dropped" and
"unbounded" together are a self-inflicted denial of service. `data.from` is attacker-controlled
— any external sender chooses their own display name and address — so an oversized
`From: <200 KB display name>` would push the payload past `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` with
nothing left to shed, and the mail would suppress **its own** webhook. So `from.address` is
capped at `WEBHOOK_META_FIELD_MAX_BYTES` and `from.name` at the same cap but is *droppable*,
preserving a bounded address for routing while shedding the cosmetic part. The same cap
applies to every entry of `to` and `cc` and to `subject`. The approval never-dropped set is
bounded identically, with `actionName` and `subject` capped and `reviewer` / `taskId` /
`digest` fixed-length by construction.

`approval.requested`:

- `preview` scope: `actionArguments` **first**, dropped whole — never partially truncated,
  because a fragment of a JSON value is worse than none and the `digest` still lets the
  consumer verify what it fetches (§6.3).
- both scopes: `subject`.
- **never dropped:** `id`, `type`, `payloadVersion`, `createdAt`, `domain`, `data.object`,
  `data.taskId`, `data.taskState`, `data.reviewer`, `data.expiresAt`, `data.expiresInSec`,
  `data.digest`, `data.actionType`, `data.actionName`.

The two never-dropped sets are each exactly what that event's consumer needs to dedupe,
order or deadline, and re-fetch — so a payload degraded by overflow is still actionable, it
just carries less description. For approvals that set is deliberately generous: `digest`,
`actionType`, `actionName`, and `expiresAt` are the four fields a paging decision needs, and
none is large. This mirrors ntfy's existing ordered-overflow approach (`notify.ts:895-932`)
and is stated normatively because an integrator needs to know which fields can vanish. If
dropping every droppable field still does not fit, the delivery fails closed rather than
being sent malformed.

---

## 7. Signature and verification

Consumer-facing documentation **must present this section first**, before the payload
schema. #109 requires it and it is the correct order: an integrator who cannot verify a
signature should not be reading payload fields yet.

### 7.1 Headers

| Header | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-OAE-Event` | the event type — `mail.received`, `approval.requested`, or `webhook.ping` | Route before parsing (GitHub). **Always byte-identical to the body's `type` field**, so a consumer may use either; the header exists so it need not parse first. |
| `X-OAE-Delivery` | `dlv_` + UUIDv4 | One **attempt**. Distinct from `id`, which is per **event**. Support and redelivery vocabulary. |
| `X-OAE-Signature` | `t=<unix-seconds>,v1=<hex>[,v1=<hex>]` | Timestamp + one or more signatures. Uniformly comma-delimited (Stripe's grammar); `v1` may repeat during rotation. |
| `User-Agent` | `openagentemail-webhooks/1` | Egress identification; lets a consumer's WAF allowlist OAE. |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Always. |

`X-OAE-Delivery` changes on every retry attempt; `id` in the body does not. Consumers
dedupe on `id`, and use `X-OAE-Delivery` only when asking OAE's operator or logs about a
specific attempt.

### 7.2 Signed string (normative)

```
signedPayload = t + "." + rawRequestBody
signature     = lower-case hex HMAC-SHA256(endpointSigningKey, signedPayload)
headerValue   = "t=" + t + ",v1=" + signature        (append ",v1=" + signature per extra key)
```

where `t` is the Unix timestamp in **whole seconds** at signature construction time, and
`rawRequestBody` is the exact UTF-8 byte sequence placed on the wire.

The header is a comma-delimited list of `key=value` pairs in which `t` appears exactly once
and first, and `v1` appears one or more times. Splitting on `,` and then on the first `=`
is a complete parser; there is no second delimiter and no nesting. Unknown keys must be
ignored rather than rejected, which is what lets `v2=` be added later (§7.6).

The `t + "." + body` construction is unambiguous without length prefixes because `t` is a
fixed-format non-negative integer, so the first `.` in the signed string is always the
separator. If OAE ever signs a multi-field tuple with free-form text in a leading field,
it must adopt the `mail-body-v2` length-prefix construction (`mail-stamp.ts:79`) instead.
That alternative is recorded here so the choice is deliberate rather than accidental.

**Encoding: lower-case hex, not base64url.** This is a conscious deviation from the
repository's stamp convention (`taskStamp`, `mail-stamp`, `mail-cursor` all use
base64url). The reason is that those are verified by OAE's own code, whereas a webhook
signature is verified by third parties whose existing snippets, libraries, and stack
overflow answers all assume hex — GitHub uses `sha256=<hex>`, Stripe uses `v1=<hex>`.
Internal consistency is worth less than integrator familiarity at a public boundary.
Flagged for ratification as §16, Q13.

### 7.3 Verification procedure

Documented as an ordered procedure, with the failure mode of skipping each step:

1. **Read the raw body bytes.** Verify against the bytes as received. Re-serializing a
   parsed JSON object will produce different bytes (key order, whitespace, escaping,
   number spelling) and verification will fail. This is the single most common webhook
   integration bug and it is why this section precedes the schema.
2. **Extract `t` and every `v1=` value** from `X-OAE-Signature`. Multiple signatures are
   allowed and **all** must be tried; success on any one is success (§12.2).
3. **Check the timestamp.** Reject if `abs(now - t) > WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC`
   (default 300). Skipping this step removes replay protection entirely, because the
   signature alone is valid forever.
4. **Recompute** `HMAC-SHA256(key, t + "." + rawBody)` for each candidate signature and
   compare in **constant time** with an equal-length guard, as `mail-stamp.ts:115` does.
   A non-constant-time comparison leaks the digest byte-by-byte over the network.
5. **Fail closed — but only after trying every *supported* scheme.** Missing header,
   malformed header, timestamp skew, or no matching signature among the schemes the consumer
   implements all reject the delivery. An **unrecognized** key in the header (`v2=`, or
   anything else from a future OAE) is **ignored, not rejected**, per §7.2 — otherwise the
   first additive scheme rollout would break every consumer that had not yet upgraded, which
   is the exact failure §7.6 exists to prevent. There is no unsigned or warn-only mode.
6. **Dedupe on `id`**, then process. At-least-once means duplicates are normal (§8.1).

Operators can verify an endpoint by hand:

```sh
# Illustrative manual check — not a reference implementation.
printf '%s.%s' "$T" "$RAW_BODY" \
  | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$ENDPOINT_SECRET" -hex
```

### 7.4 Replay protection

Two independent layers, because a webhook endpoint is a public URL:

- **Timestamp tolerance** (§7.3 step 3) bounds the useful lifetime of a captured delivery
  to 300 s. This is stateless — it costs OAE nothing and requires no nonce store, which
  matters because there is no database.
- **Idempotency on `id`** on the consumer side, which also handles legitimate duplicate
  delivery from retries.

A captured delivery replayed *within* the tolerance window to the *same* endpoint is not
defended against, and cannot be cheaply: the attacker would already need the endpoint's
secret-bearing channel. This limitation is stated rather than papered over, because the
alternative (server-side nonces) requires durable state OAE does not have.

### 7.5 Why not canonical JSON

`approvalActionDigest` signs a canonicalized JSON form (`docs/approval-digest.md`):
recursively sorted keys by UTF-16 code unit, `JSON.stringify` escaping and number
spelling, no whitespace, `-0` normalized to `0`. That machinery exists because **two
independent implementations must produce identical bytes** — an approval decision is
hashed by the API and re-hashed by a verifier that never saw the original serialization,
and the repo ships committed interop vectors checked by an independent Python verifier.

Webhooks have the opposite shape: **one producer, many verifiers, and the verifier sees
the exact bytes on the wire.** No canonicalization is needed, and adopting it would be
actively harmful — it would oblige every third-party consumer in every language to
reimplement ECMA-262 number spelling and UTF-16 key ordering correctly, which is exactly
the portability trap `docs/approval-digest.md` has to spend four paragraphs warning
about. Signing the transmitted bytes removes that entire class of integration failure.

Recorded here because "reuse the existing canonical JSON" is the obvious-looking suggestion
and it is wrong for this use case.

### 7.6 Versioning

- `payloadVersion` in the body tracks the **schema**; the `v1=` prefix in the header
  tracks the **signature scheme**. They are versioned independently because they break
  independently.
- Additive schema changes do not bump `payloadVersion`.
- A new signature scheme (e.g. Ed25519 for #59 federation) adds `v2=` **alongside**
  `v1=` during an overlap window; the header format already permits multiple entries.
- **Both halves of this are proven in production elsewhere.** Stripe's header still carries
  a legacy `v0=` next to `v1=` (§4.2), which is direct evidence that a versioned prefix
  lets two schemes coexist for years without breaking consumers. And SendGrid's outbound
  Event Webhook signs with **ECDSA** over timestamp + raw payload bytes (§4.3), so
  asymmetric webhook signing is a shipping commercial practice, not an exotic design OAE
  would be pioneering.
- **Forward compatibility with #59 is the reason for the prefix.** Federation needs
  asymmetric signatures with key ids and `.well-known` discovery. An asymmetric scheme
  slots into the same header as `v2=<kid>.<sig>` without changing the envelope, the
  timestamp binding, or any consumer's routing logic. Nothing in v1 needs to be undone to
  get there. That is the only federation-related commitment in this RFC, and it is free.

## 8. Delivery semantics

### 8.1 At-least-once

Every guarantee OAE makes, stated plainly so it can be quoted in user docs:

- A delivery that returns `2xx` within the timeout is **successful** and is not retried.
- An event may be delivered **more than once**. Retries, process restarts, and
  `UIDVALIDITY` re-anchoring (§3.1) can each cause duplicates.
- An event may be delivered **out of order** (§8.4).
- An event may be **not delivered at all** if the endpoint fails for longer than the
  retry budget, or if the process is stopped before the queue drains. This is recorded in
  the delivery log as a dead letter (§8.6) and surfaced (§13) — it is never silent.

**Consumers must be idempotent on `id`.** This is a normative consumer requirement, not a
suggestion, and it belongs in the first paragraph of the user-facing docs.

### 8.2 Outcome classification

| Outcome | Condition | Retried? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | any `2xx` within `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | no |
| retryable | connection error, DNS failure at delivery time, timeout, `5xx`, `408`, `429` | yes |
| permanent | any other `4xx`, **or any `3xx`** (redirects are never followed, §9.4) | **no** — dead-letter immediately |
| refused | SSRF policy violation resolved at delivery time (§9.3) | **no** — dead-letter + disable endpoint |
| deferred | OAE's **own** local limit denied the attempt — per-endpoint delivery rate (§8.7) or the instance-wide concurrency pool being full | **yes** — rescheduled, and it does **not** consume an attempt |

`deferred` is its own outcome because it is not a failure and must not be accounted as one.
A healthy address that receives more than `WEBHOOK_RATE_DELIVER_PER_MIN` deliverable events in
a minute will have attempts denied *by OAE*, and charging those against the endpoint would
mean a busy mailbox disables its own healthy endpoint. So a `deferred` attempt: consumes no
slot in the §8.3 schedule, does not increment `consecutiveFailures` (§8.5), is not dead-lettered,
and is rescheduled at the **later** of the limiter's `retryAfterSec` and the next schedule
offset. Taking the *earlier* of the two — as a first draft specified — hot-loops: if the next
offset is already past, the retry fires immediately, the limiter denies it again, and the
delivery spins until the window opens, burning CPU and log rows without making progress.
`max()` guarantees forward progress at whichever of the two constraints is actually binding.

The two causes of `deferred` need different delays, and only one of them produces a
`retryAfterSec`:

| Cause | Reschedule at |
| --- | --- |
| per-endpoint rate limit denied | `max(limiter retryAfterSec, next schedule offset)` |
| instance concurrency pool full (§8.7) | `now + WEBHOOK_POOL_RETRY_MS` (default **5000**), since a full pool yields no `retryAfterSec` at all |

Without a defined delay for pool saturation, the second case has nothing to schedule on and
would either spin or fall through to the next 72-hour offset — a five-second capacity blip
costing two hours of latency. `WEBHOOK_POOL_RETRY_MS` is bounded below at 1000 ms so it cannot
be configured into a spin.

Rescheduling is **bounded** — a `deferred` row still carries `nextAttemptAt` and is
subject to the same 72-hour horizon, so backpressure delays delivery rather than creating an
unbounded queue. If backpressure or pool saturation delays the attempt past the 72-hour horizon from `eventCreatedAt`, the attempt is terminated with dead-letter row `outcome: "permanent"` and `reason: "retry_horizon_exceeded"`. This is the classification the first draft left empty.

`429` honours a consumer's `Retry-After` header when it is a sane integer
(1 s … 1 h), clamped into the schedule; otherwise the normal backoff applies. Honoring
`Retry-After` is cheap politeness that materially reduces load on a rate-limited
consumer.

`refused` is its own outcome rather than a variant of `permanent` because it has a
different operator meaning: the endpoint is not broken, it is **disallowed**, and retrying
would mean OAE repeatedly attempting a blocked connection to an internal address. That
must stop immediately and loudly (§9).

### 8.3 Retry schedule

Eleven attempts spanning exactly **72 hours**, per decision **D2** (§17), which extended this
document's original ~27 h recommendation to align with Stripe's and SendGrid's three-day
budgets. Attempts 1–7 keep the front-loaded shape Resend publishes (§4.3); attempts 8–11
extend the tail to three days at roughly half-day and daily cadence.

| Attempt | Offset from first attempt |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 (immediate) |
| 2 | +5 s |
| 3 | +5 min |
| 4 | +30 min |
| 5 | +2 h |
| 6 | +5 h |
| 7 | +10 h |
| 8 | +20 h |
| 9 | +34 h |
| 10 | +48 h |
| 11 | **+72 h** |

**These are cumulative offsets from the first attempt, stated normatively.** The first draft
of this section specified inter-attempt *delays*, and criticized Resend for not
disambiguating delays from offsets (§4.3). At a 27-hour horizon that was a manageable
ambiguity; at 72 hours it is not, because eleven delay values have to be summed correctly by
every reader and every implementation to know when the last attempt happens. Offsets are
self-describing, so the ambiguity this RFC objected to is removed rather than inherited.

The shape is doing two different jobs, and only the first one changed:

- **Attempts 1–4 (first ~35 minutes) serve perishability.** An OTP or verification link is
  acted on within minutes; four attempts inside half an hour means a transient consumer
  error, a deploy, or a single bad response never costs the agent the mail. This half is
  unchanged from the original design and is the reason a three-day budget costs nothing for
  urgent mail — the urgent attempts already happened on day one.
- **Attempts 5–11 (out to 72 hours) serve availability.** They cover an overnight outage, a
  weekend, a consumer host that is down for a day, or an integrator who notices on Monday
  that their endpoint broke on Friday. This is what D2 bought.

After attempt 11 the event is dead-lettered (§8.6) and counts toward the circuit breaker
(§8.5).

**Jitter, and why it must not be applied naively.** Jitter is needed because many subscribers
on one instance fail simultaneously when a popular consumer or a shared hosting provider has
an outage, and correlated retries arrive as a thundering herd on an already-struggling
endpoint. But drawing each gap from `uniform(0, gap)` — textbook full jitter — makes every
offset an *upper bound*, so the final attempt typically lands well before +72 h and sometimes
hours early. That silently breaks D2's normative promise of a three-day horizon and weakens
exactly the weekend-outage coverage the tail was extended to buy. So:

- Jitter shifts each attempt by up to ±10% of **its own gap**, never cumulatively, and offsets
  are clamped to stay monotonically increasing.
- **Attempt 11 is pinned to exactly +72 h**, unjittered. The published horizon is a promise,
  not a maximum.
- Attempt 1 is never delayed.

The §8.3 table is therefore the **actual** schedule within ±10%, not a set of upper bounds —
which is what makes it safe for an integrator to plan a catch-up job against.

`WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default **11**, minimum 1, maximum 11) **truncates this table**; there
is no base or multiplier knob, because a fixed published schedule is easier for an integrator
to reason about than a formula. `=1` gives fire-and-forget, `=4` gives the perishability-only
front half (~35 minutes), and `=8` gives a **+20 h** horizon. Note that `=8` is *not* the
~27 h budget this document originally recommended: that figure came from summing eight
inter-attempt *delays*, whereas this table lists cumulative *offsets*, and attempt 8 sits at
+20 h. The upper bound of 11 is enforced in the schema because the table defines exactly
eleven offsets — a larger value would have no defined attempt times.

`webhook.ping` uses attempts 1–3 only (~5 minutes). A connectivity test that takes three days
to report failure is useless as a test.

**Two consequences of the three-day horizon, stated because they change other sections:**

1. **The durable queue horizon is now three days.** §8.6 reconstructs pending retries from
   `webhook-deliveries.jsonl` at boot, so that file must hold up to three days of
   not-yet-final rows per endpoint. `WEBHOOK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS = 30` covers this
   comfortably, but the boot reconstruction is no longer a small scan on a busy instance and
   must be indexed by `(webhookId, eventId)` rather than read linearly.
2. **The circuit-breaker counter interacts with the longer schedule, and D2a settled how.**
   Extending to 11 attempts per event raised the question of what `WEBHOOK_DISABLE_THRESHOLD`
   counts. This document proposed counting *exhausted events*, worried that counting attempts
   would let two failing events trip the breaker on day one and make the three-day budget
   unreachable. Decision **D2a** (§17) overruled that and kept **consecutive failed attempts,
   per endpoint, reset to zero on any success, threshold 10** — correctly, because an event
   only exhausts after its full 72 hours, so a breaker waiting for exhaustion cannot fire
   until two days after the endpoint broke. The original worry is answered by reset-on-success
   instead: a flaky endpoint that mostly works is never disabled, while a genuinely dead one
   trips as fast as failures accumulate. See §8.5 for the full rule, including which outcomes
   count and the volume dependence of wall-clock trip time.

**What survives of the original argument against three days.** §4.2 argued for ~27 hours on
two grounds: mail is perishable, and the durable store is a JSONL file rather than a
database, so queue horizon is a real cost. D2 overrides the conclusion, and the first ground
is now moot because front-loading means perishable mail is served on day one regardless. The
second ground is *not* moot — it is what consequence 1 above records — so it is carried
forward as a design constraint on §8.6 rather than deleted. **Why not the watcher's existing
10 minutes** (`SERVICE_FAILURE_MAX_MS`, `notification-watcher.ts:50`): a webhook consumer is
an external party that may be mid-deploy. **Why not GitHub's model** (no automatic retry at
all, §4.1): a failed delivery nobody retries is a silently dropped event, which is precisely
what #109 forbids.

### 8.4 Ordering: not guaranteed

**OAE makes no ordering guarantee, and this RFC recommends against attempting one.** The
reasons are structural, not implementation laziness:

- Retries reorder by construction. An event that fails once and succeeds at attempt 3
  arrives after events emitted later that succeeded at attempt 1.
- Deliveries to different endpoints are independent, and deliveries to one endpoint are
  capped at concurrency 1 (§8.7) but still interleave with retries.
- The event source's UID watermark is re-anchored when `UIDVALIDITY` changes
  (§3.1), which can produce gaps or repeats independent of delivery.

What OAE provides instead, so a consumer that *needs* order can establish it:

1. **`data.receivedAt`, then `data.uid`** — the authoritative per-address ordering key, and
   the same `(t desc, uid desc)` order the IMAP layer and the list API use
   (`mail-cursor.ts:22`). Compare `receivedAt` first, break ties on the numeric `uid`, and
   only within one `data.uidValidity` — UIDs from different mailbox generations are not
   comparable, and a re-anchoring (§3.1) restarts them.
2. **Not `data.cursor`.** The cursor *encodes* that same order, but its wire form is
   base64url-encoded JSON followed by an HMAC (`mail-cursor.ts:47-57`), and neither encoding
   preserves numeric order. It is **opaque**: sorting cursor strings lexicographically
   produces a wrong order that looks plausible, which is worse than no order at all. The
   cursor is a resume token to hand back to the API, never a sort key. The first draft of
   this section told consumers to sort by it and was simply wrong.
3. **`createdAt`** — emission time, useful only for latency measurement, **not** for
   ordering mail.

A consumer requiring strict order should treat webhooks as a *wakeup signal* and read
authoritative state through the list API, which is ordered and paginated at the IMAP layer.
That pattern — push to wake, pull to read — is the recommended integration shape, and it is
also what makes the payload bounding in §6.5 acceptable. It does depend on the prerequisite in
§3.7, and that prerequisite is **larger than exposing the existing cursor**: the cursor OAE
has today paginates *backwards* (`isAfterCursor()` selects older mail), so it cannot express
"everything since my last delivery". Forward catch-up needs a new `since` query. Until it
lands, the bearer list API returns only the newest N messages with no resume token in either
direction, and a consumer catching up after an outage must fall back to polling the newest N
and deduping on `messageId` — which works, but only for outages shorter than N messages.

### 8.5 Circuit breaker and endpoint state

An endpoint has exactly one `state`, persisted in `webhooks.json` (§10.5) so a restart cannot
silently reset it, with every contributing attempt recorded individually in the delivery log
(§8.6):

```
unverified ──(first successful delivery)──> enabled ──(threshold / refused / manual)──> disabled
     ▲                                          ▲                                            │
     └──────────(POST /:id/test)────────────────┴────────(POST /:id/enable, admin)───────────┘
```

`disabled` always carries a `disabledReason` of `"threshold"` (circuit breaker), `"refused"`
(SSRF, §9.3), or `"manual"` (operator pause via `POST …/disable`). The reason matters because
recovery differs: a manual pause is resumed without investigation, while `threshold` and
`refused` mean something is actually wrong and §8.5's manual-re-enable rule exists to make
somebody look. This is why there is no separate `active` boolean (§10.5) — one state field
plus a reason expresses strictly more than two overlapping on/off switches.

- **`unverified`** — the initial state on creation. Decision **D12** (§17) made creation
  asynchronous, so OAE does not block `POST /v1/webhooks` on a third party's latency; instead
  the endpoint is created, a `webhook.ping` is fired in the background, and the state stays
  `unverified` until some delivery succeeds. **Events are still delivered while
  `unverified`** — the state is advisory, not a gate, because a correctly configured endpoint
  should not have to wait for a ping round-trip before receiving real mail. Its purpose is
  operator feedback: the dashboard (§10.8) and `GET /v1/webhooks/:id` show it, so "I created
  this and never checked it" is visible.
- **`enabled`** — normal delivery.
- **`disabled`** — OAE makes **no** delivery attempts. New events for that endpoint are
  dead-lettered immediately rather than queued, so a dead endpoint cannot accumulate an
  unbounded backlog over the three-day retry horizon (§8.3).

**Disablement threshold: consecutive failed *attempts*, reset on any success.** Per decision
**D2a** (§17), which overrode this document's proposal:

- The counter is **per endpoint** and increments on every delivery attempt whose outcome is
  `retryable` or `permanent` (§8.2).
- **Any successful delivery resets it to zero.** This is what makes attempt-counting safe, and
  it is the whole reason the ruling works: an endpoint that fails once and recovers is never
  disabled, no matter how busy it is.
- `deferred` does **not** count (§8.2). That outcome means OAE's own limiter refused the
  attempt, so the endpoint is healthy and charging it would let a busy mailbox disable itself.
- `refused` disables **immediately**, without waiting for the threshold — an SSRF refusal is a
  configuration or attack signal, not a transient outage.
- At `WEBHOOK_DISABLE_THRESHOLD` (default **10**) consecutive counted failures, the endpoint
  transitions to `disabled` with a `disabledReason`.

**Why attempts rather than exhausted events.** This document originally proposed counting
events that had run out of retries, on the reasoning that 11 attempts per event would let two
failing events trip the breaker on day one. The commander overruled it, correctly: an event
only *exhausts* after its full 72-hour schedule, so a breaker that waits for exhaustion cannot
fire until two days after the endpoint broke — by which point it has stopped being a breaker
and become a post-mortem. The concern that motivated the original proposal is handled instead
by reset-on-success, which preserves exactly the case the long retry budget exists for (a
flaky endpoint that mostly works) while killing a genuinely dead one quickly.

Threshold 10 follows the common consecutive-failure breaker convention rather than a
request-volume-plus-error-rate window (Hystrix-style), because per-endpoint concurrency is 1
(§8.7) and there is no meaningful rate to window over.

**One honest property, since it affects operator expectations: wall-clock trip time depends on
event volume.** A single event's attempts are spread across the 72-hour schedule (§8.3), so on
a *quiet* mailbox one dead endpoint accrues its 10th consecutive failure at roughly +48 h —
the offset of attempt 10. On a *busy* mailbox, attempts from successive events interleave by
due time, so 10 consecutive failures arrive within the first ~35 minutes (attempts 1–4 of the
first few events all land inside that window). Both behaviors are correct: a dead endpoint is
disabled as fast as the evidence accumulates, and the evidence accumulates as fast as mail
arrives. Operators who want faster trip on quiet mailboxes lower `WEBHOOK_DISABLE_THRESHOLD`;
there is no separate volume knob, and adding one would make the breaker's behavior hard to
reason about.

**The interaction with D2, stated rather than left to be discovered.** Threshold 10 against an
11-attempt schedule means a quiet mailbox with a single dead event trips at attempt 10 (+48 h),
so **attempt 11 — the one §8.3 pins to exactly +72 h — never runs** for that event. The
published 72-hour horizon is therefore a property of the *schedule*, not a guarantee that every
event on a dead endpoint receives eleven attempts; on a dead endpoint the breaker is supposed
to cut the sequence short, and that is the point of D2a. The two sections are consistent once
read this way: §8.3 describes how far an attempt sequence *can* go, §8.5 describes when the
endpoint stops being tried at all. Neither is changed here — this paragraph exists so nobody
files it as a contradiction later. An endpoint that is merely *flaky* still gets the full
horizon, because each success resets the counter.

- Disablement is written to the audit log, exposed on `GET /v1/webhooks/:id` and in the
  dashboard (§10.8), and — where ntfy is enabled — pushed to the operator as an urgent
  notification through the existing notify path. That last step is best-effort and must not
  itself block or throw.
- Re-enable is **manual**: `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/enable`, which resets the counter, returns
  the endpoint to `unverified`, and fires a `webhook.ping`.

Manual rather than automatic re-enable is a deliberate choice. None of the vendors surveyed
documents automatic recovery: Resend documents auto-*disablement* plus a second
notification (§4.3) but says nothing about re-enabling, and Stripe documents neither.
Silently resuming delivery would hide the fact that a window of events was dropped. The
operator should have to look. The dropped window is inspectable (§8.6), and the cursor in
the last successful delivery tells the consumer exactly where to resume.

### 8.6 Persistence

OAE has no database, so the durable design must be a file, and the repository already has
a proven shape for one.

**`DATA_DIR/webhook-deliveries.jsonl`** — append-only, 0600 in a 0700 directory, single
writer, atomic `.tmp` + rename for compaction, fsync of file and directory, corrupt file
fails closed. These are exactly the conventions of `notification-log.jsonl`,
`audit.jsonl`, and `notification-devices.json` (§3.5, §3.6) and are not re-litigated here.

Each row records one delivery attempt:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-09-03T12:26:40.512Z",
  "webhookId": "whk_4a1b…",
  "eventId": "evt_2b0e…",
  "runId": "run_0",
  "deliveryId": "dlv_6f1c…",
  "type": "mail.received",
  "address": "postmaster@openagent.email",
  "messageId": "4821",
  "uidValidity": 17,
  "rfc822MessageId": "<20260903122639.4821@mail.openagent.email>",
  "taskId": null,
  "taskCreatedAt": null,
  "expiresInSec": null,
  "eventCreatedAt": "2026-09-03T12:26:40.412Z",
  "attempt": 1,
  "outcome": "pending",
  "status": null,
  "durationMs": null,
  "sensitive": false,
  "replay": false,
  "nextAttemptAt": "2026-09-03T12:26:40.512Z"
}
```

Eight of those fields exist because something breaks without them:

- **`runId`** (`run_0` for the original sequence, `run_1`, `run_2`, … for each manual
  redelivery) separates independent attempt sequences. Redelivery deliberately preserves the
  event `id` (§10.3), so without `runId` a replay is indistinguishable from the original: if
  the original succeeded on attempt 3 and a later replay fails on attempt 1, selecting the
  highest attempt for the pair picks the *old success* and silently discards the replay's
  pending retry. Repeated replays collapse the same way.
- **`eventCreatedAt`** is the envelope's `createdAt`, distinct from `ts` (the log-write
  instant of this attempt). A queued event's first attempt can be long after its creation, and
  after a restart there is no other source for the original emission instant — rebuilding
  without it would either change `createdAt` for the same `eventId` or substitute an inaccurate
  time, breaking latency measurement and the consumer's view of a stable envelope.
- **`outcome: "pending"`** is the durable record of a **scheduled but not yet attempted**
  delivery. §11.4 promises a saturated pool writes the event to the log rather than dropping
  it, and without a `pending` outcome that promise has nowhere to land: §8.6 is one row per
  attempt, so an unattempted event would leave no row for boot reconstruction to find and
  would be lost precisely under burst load.
- **`uidValidity`** guards `messageId`, which is a UID and stops being addressable when the
  mailbox generation changes (§8.6 reconstruction rules).
- **`messageId`** is what makes re-fetch possible at all for mail, since the payload is
  deliberately not stored. It is an identifier, not content — the distinction `audit.ts` draws
  when it allows `address` but forbids subjects and bodies.
- **`taskId`** is the equivalent for `approval.requested`, and omitting it was a real bug: the
  reconstruction text below says approvals re-fetch "by task id", but no such field existed in
  the row, so a pending approval event could not be rebuilt after a restart and would have been
  silently dropped — losing exactly the human-paging event D1 put into v1 for. Per event type:
  `mail.received` populates `messageId` + `uidValidity` and leaves `taskId` null;
  `approval.requested` populates `taskId` and leaves both mail fields null.
- **`taskCreatedAt`** and **`expiresInSec`** are persisted for `approval.requested` rows so that
  boot reconstruction preserves the exact task creation instant and original relative expiration
  rather than drifting timestamps or re-evaluating remaining seconds upon restart (Item 9).
- **`rfc822MessageId`** is the message's RFC 822 `Message-ID` header when it has one, and
  exists solely to enable the cross-generation fallback in the reconstruction rules below.
  It is bounded to at most 512 bytes (UTF-8); overlong values are treated as null and dead-lettered
  upon generation rolls rather than persisting unbounded identifier bytes.
  Like `messageId` it is an identifier rather than content, so it does not weaken the
  no-payload rule. Null when the message had no such header, which is why that branch
  dead-letters instead of guessing.
- **`replay`** is `true` only on a delivery created by
  `POST /v1/webhooks/deliveries/:deliveryId/redeliver` (decision **D15**, §17), so an operator
  reading the log can tell a replay from an original.

Rules:

- Retention `WEBHOOK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30), matching
  `NOTIFICATION_LOG_RETENTION_MS` and `RETENTION_DAYS`. Daily and boot-time compaction. The
  minimum is tied to the retry horizon — see §10.1, since a retention window shorter than the
  72-hour schedule would delete the only durable record of a pending attempt before that
  attempt is due.
- **No payload content is ever written**, and no URL query string. The same field-whitelist
  discipline `audit.ts:38-50` applies, extended with delivery-specific identifiers. This keeps
  the log safe to expose through an inspection API and safe to ship to a log aggregator.
- **`sensitive` is a marker, not a reducer.** An earlier draft said a `sensitive: true` row
  "writes nothing beyond" the event id, type, address, and outcome. That was wrong and the
  consequence was severe: it dropped `webhookId`, `runId`, `attempt`, and `nextAttemptAt`, so
  **every pending `preview`-scope delivery would be silently lost at restart** — the rows the
  reconstruction algorithm needs would not contain the fields it groups and schedules by. Since
  the row already contains no payload content by the rule above, there is nothing further to
  strip. `sensitive` exists so an operator or an aggregator can filter or mask these rows
  externally, and so the inspection API can label them; it never changes what is written.
- **Minimum reconstructable field set.** No reduction, masking, or retention rule may remove
  these from a non-final row, because boot reconstruction cannot work without them:
  `webhookId`, `eventId`, `runId`, `attempt`, `outcome`, `nextAttemptAt`, `type`, `address`,
  `eventCreatedAt`, and the resource identifier for the event type (`messageId` +
  `uidValidity` for mail, `taskId` for approvals). Everything else in the row is diagnostic.
- The file doubles as the **dead-letter store**: a row with `outcome: "permanent"` or
  `"refused"`, or a *completed* attempt at `WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` without success, *is* the
  dead letter. One artifact, two purposes, no separate queue file.

**Restart behavior, stated honestly:**

- Subscription configuration survives restart (it is in `webhooks.json`, §10.5).
- The delivery log survives restart, so the dead-letter record is durable and inspectable.
- **Pending retries are reconstructed from the log at boot**, by this algorithm. It is
  stated as steps because two plausible-sounding shortcuts are both wrong, and review caught
  both:

  1. Group rows by **`(webhookId, eventId, runId)`**. The `webhookId` matters because one
     event fans out to N endpoints (§5.1), so keying on `eventId` alone would let a success
     for endpoint A silently cancel endpoint B's outstanding retries. The `runId` matters
     because a manual redelivery reuses the `eventId` (§10.3), so without it a replay's
     pending retry is discarded in favour of the original run's final row.
  2. Within each group take **only the row with the highest `attempt`**, tie-broken on `ts`.
     Every earlier row is history, not work. Selecting all rows whose `nextAttemptAt` is in
     the future — the obvious reading — enqueues one retry per past failure, because after
     two failed attempts *both* rows still carry a future `nextAttemptAt`. That violates
     per-endpoint concurrency 1 (§8.7) and burns the budget several times over. A `pending`
     row has `attempt` equal to the attempt it is scheduled to make, so it participates in
     this comparison normally.
  3. Discard the group if that latest row is **final**, meaning either (a) its `outcome` is
     `success`, `permanent`, or `refused`, or (b) its `outcome` is a *completed* failure
     (`retryable`) **and** `attempt >= WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.

     Condition (b) carries the qualification deliberately, and omitting it loses the last
     attempt. The row for attempt N is written as `pending` *before* the attempt is made, so a
     crash between writing attempt 11's `pending` row and sending it leaves a latest row with
     `attempt == WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and a non-success outcome. A rule keyed only on
     `attempt >= MAX` would classify that as final and discard it — the eleventh attempt, the
     one pinned to +72 h, would never be made, and the event would vanish without a
     dead-letter row saying so. A `pending` row always means "not yet attempted", at whatever
     attempt number, and is therefore never final.
  4. Otherwise the group is pending. Schedule it at
     **`max(nextAttemptAt, bootTime)`** — that is, a row whose `nextAttemptAt` fell *during*
     the downtime runs **immediately**, it is not skipped. Filtering on
     `nextAttemptAt > now` instead would silently truncate the 72-hour sequence for any
     outage that spans a scheduled attempt, which is most outages, and would contradict the
     restart guarantee this section states.
  5. Rebuild the payload (§below) and hand it to the delivery pool.

  Indexing by the pair is not optional polish: under the 72-hour budget D2 adopted (§8.3)
  the pending window can hold three days of rows per endpoint, so a linear scan of a 30-day
  log at every boot would be the slowest part of startup.
- **Reconstruction re-builds the payload; it does not replay stored bytes.** No payload is
  ever written (§8.6 rules below), so recovery must re-fetch. The two event types differ
  here, and only one of them is easy:

  - **`approval.requested`** re-fetches by task id, which has a real lookup primitive
    (`getTaskSnapshot()`), so reconstruction is exact and survives any IMAP renumbering.
  - **`mail.received`** has no lookup-by-UUID primitive: the OAE message id **is** the IMAP
    UID within the inbox, and a UID is only addressable while `UIDVALIDITY` is unchanged.
    `lib/imap.ts` never mentions `uidValidity` at all, so nothing today detects the mismatch.
    The log row therefore records **`uidValidity`** at emission, and reconstruction proceeds
    in exactly two cases:

    1. **Generation matches** — fetch by UID. This is the normal path.
    2. **Generation differs** — fall back to an RFC 822 `Message-ID` header search, which the
       row also records when the message had one. This is the *only* recovery path, and it is
       deliberately narrow:
       - **No `Message-ID` recorded** (the header is optional in practice) → dead-letter with
         outcome `permanent`, reason `uidvalidity_changed`.
       - **The header search returns zero or more than one match** → same dead-letter. A
         non-unique match is not guessed at, because delivering the wrong message's content
         under the original `eventId` is the exact failure §6.2's refetch warning exists to
         prevent.
       - **Exactly one match** → rebuild, and the rebuilt payload's `messageId`, `uid`, and
         `uidValidity` are set from the **newly fetched** message, not copied from the log
         row; `data.cursor` is regenerated against the current generation. The `eventId` and
         `eventCreatedAt` are preserved, so the consumer's dedupe key is stable while the
         identifiers that describe *where the message now lives* are honest about the new
         generation.

    An earlier draft said both "dead-letter on mismatch" and "a Message-ID fallback may be
    used", which is not a specification. The rule above is ordered and total: every branch
    terminates in either a rebuilt delivery or a dead letter with a reason.

  In every case the rebuilt delivery keeps the **original** `eventId`, preserving the
  consumer's dedupe key across a restart. If the message is genuinely gone (retention,
  manual deletion), the delivery is dead-lettered with outcome `permanent`. A consequence
  worth stating: a rebuilt payload may differ from the original if the subscription's scope
  or the bounding constants changed while the process was down. That is correct behavior —
  the consumer sees current policy — and it is another reason consumers must treat the
  payload as a snapshot and re-fetch (§4.2).
- **Events emitted while the process was down are lost, and this is a certainty rather than a
  risk.** An earlier draft said the outcome "depends on watermark durability, which the
  watcher already owns". Reading the source shows there is no durability to depend on:
  `WatcherWatermark` is documented as *"In-memory watermark survives a dropped IMAP connection
  in this process"* (`notification-watcher.ts:138`), `runWatcher()` starts each run with a
  fresh `const watermark: WatcherWatermark = {}` (`:1555`), and on first sight of a mailbox
  generation it **anchors to the current high-water UID and returns an empty list**
  (`:216-218`, `:223-226`). So after a restart the watcher emits nothing for mail that
  arrived while it was down and picks up only from whatever is newest at that moment. The
  in-memory watermark buys resilience across a *dropped connection*, which is what it was
  built for — not across a *process restart*.

  This is the concrete content of the weak restart semantics D7 accepted, and it is worse than
  "some events may be missed": a restart during a busy period silently skips every message
  that landed in the gap. Boot reconstruction (§8.6) recovers **pending retries** from the
  delivery log, but it cannot recover an event that was never emitted, because nothing was
  ever written. Making post-restart catch-up authoritative — re-walk the mailbox from the last
  successfully delivered position and re-emit — therefore requires persisting a watermark that
  does not exist today, and is §16 Q5. It is also the strongest argument for the forward
  cursor in §3.7: without one, there is no "last delivered position" to re-walk *from*.

### 8.7 Concurrency and rate limits

Reuse `slidingWindowCheck()` (`ratelimit.ts:26`) and the wait-slot pattern
(`ratelimit.ts:205-206`) rather than adding a new primitive:

| Limit | Proposed default | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| concurrent deliveries, per endpoint | 1 | Preserves per-endpoint attempt order, and stops one slow consumer from consuming the pool. |
| concurrent deliveries, instance-wide | `WEBHOOK_MAX_CONCURRENT = 8` | Mirrors `MAX_WAITS_TOTAL = 8`. A webhook pool must not be able to starve `mail_wait_for`, so these are **separate** pools (§11.3). |
| delivery attempts per endpoint per minute | `WEBHOOK_RATE_DELIVER_PER_MIN` = 60 | Bounds a hot mailbox pointed at a slow endpoint. |
| subscription creates per token per minute | `WEBHOOK_RATE_CREATE_PER_MIN` = 10 | Bounds endpoint-churn abuse. |
| **`POST /:id/test` calls *and* creation-triggered pings, per token per minute** | `WEBHOOK_RATE_TEST_PER_MIN` = 3 **triggers** | **One shared probe bucket for both**, because both originate outbound connections on demand. Bounding only `/test` leaves the create path as an equivalent channel: each successful create fires an asynchronous `webhook.ping` (§5.1), and creation is allowed 10/min, so delete-and-recreate yields 10+ triggers/min with observable `state` / `lastDelivery` feedback. Separate from the delivery bucket, which is per endpoint and not caller-triggered. **The bucket counts triggers, not connections, and the honest ceiling is 3× higher:** each accepted ping runs attempts 1–3 (§8.3), so 3 triggers/min is up to **9 connection attempts/min per token** spread over ~5 minutes. Retries are not charged to the caller's bucket because they are not caller-initiated and fire long after the request returns — charging them would need the bucket key persisted onto the delivery row for no security gain, since the total is already bounded by (trigger limit × ping attempts). What matters is that the *stated* bound is the real one: 9/min, not 3/min. This is the mitigation §12.5 called "obvious"; this row is where it actually lives. |
| subscriptions per instance | `WEBHOOK_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS = 16` | Small by design; a mailbox does not need 200 callbacks. |
| subscriptions per address | `WEBHOOK_MAX_PER_ADDRESS` = 4 | Allows fan-out (agent + archiver + ntfy bridge) without unbounded growth. |

All numeric limits follow the repo's `0 = disabled` convention, **with one deliberate
exception**: `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES` and `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` take a minimum of 1
and cannot be disabled. Under the blanket convention `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES=0` would mean
an *unlimited* response read, which is the precise amplification attack §9.7 exists to prevent
— a hostile endpoint could stream an arbitrarily large body and consume unbounded memory or
hold delivery capacity. A limit whose "off" setting removes a security boundary is not a
convention worth honoring, so these two floors are enforced in the zod schema (§10.1) rather
than left to operator care.

Because limits are in-memory sliding windows they reset on restart — consistent with
every other limit in the codebase, and acceptable here because the consequence of a reset
is a brief over-delivery, not a correctness failure.

## 9. SSRF and egress safety

This is the section where a webhook feature can turn a mail server into an attack
platform. A subscription URL is a **user-supplied instruction to make the server open a
TCP connection to an arbitrary host**, and the person supplying it may hold only an
identity-scoped token.

### 9.1 Reuse the shared policy — this is a mandate, not a preference

`lib/net.ts:1` states that it is the single shared implementation for private-network and
SSRF decisions and that **copying another one is forbidden** (translated from the Chinese
source comment). Webhook egress therefore goes through `isBlockedSsrfIp()` /
`isSsrfBlockedResolvedIp()`, and the fetcher follows the `pinnedCimdFetcher()` pattern
(§3.2).

**But "reuse it" is not sufficient, and getting this wrong silently reopens the exact hole
§9.6 describes.** The private-network allowance in `isSsrfBlockedResolvedIp()` is
**opt-out, not opt-in**: an address in RFC1918 / CGNAT / loopback / ULA is *permitted*
unless `publicEdge` is set, and `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE` defaults to `'false'` (`config.ts:214`,
`net.ts:225-241`). On a stock deployment, calling the shared policy without arguments would
therefore allow a subscription aimed at `http://ntfy` — a compose-internal address — **even
with `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=false`**.

So the rule is normative and specific:

> Webhook delivery and webhook URL validation must call the shared policy with
> `publicEdge` set to **`!webhookAllowPrivateTargets || config.oaePublicEdge`** — that is,
> the webhook-specific escape hatch, OR-ed with the global public-edge setting so that the
> stricter of the two always wins.

`isSsrfBlockedResolvedIp()` already takes an `opts` parameter for exactly this, so no new
primitive is needed; what is needed is the discipline to pass it. A test asserting this
composition is §14 item 2, and it is the highest-value security test in the feature.

**Refactor scope, stated accurately.** `pinnedCimdFetcher()` (`oauth-cimd.ts:363`) is raw
Node `http`/`https` with the connect-time `lookup` hook and a capped streaming body read
(`CIMD_MAX_BYTES`, `oauth-cimd.ts:34`, `:450`); it never follows redirects because it never
asks the agent to. The `redirect: 'manual'` setting and the `redirect_forbidden` rejection
live one layer up, in the CIMD *document-fetch wrapper* (`oauth-cimd.ts:520`, `:526`,
`:543`), as does the pre-flight `assertClientIdHostSafe()` (`oauth-cimd.ts:150`) — which its
own comment marks as **for pre-flight and tests only**, with production required to use the
pinned fetcher's connect-time lookup (`oauth-cimd.ts:147`, translated). That warning is the
same point §9.3 makes, already written down in this repo.

The consequence for phasing: generalizing the *fetcher* alone does **not** carry redirect
refusal or pre-flight validation along, because those are not in it. PR 1 (§15) must
extract the fetcher **and** promote the wrapper's redirect refusal into shared policy, or
webhooks will inherit pinning without inheriting redirect safety.

### 9.2 Always refused

Regardless of any configuration, including the private-deployment escape hatch:

- `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local, and the cloud metadata endpoint `169.254.169.254`)
- `0.0.0.0/8`
- `fe80::/10`
- `fd00:ec2::/16` (AWS IMDS over IPv6)
- IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms of all of the above (`::ffff:169.254.1.1`)
- multicast, `::`, and other special-use space

These are exactly the ranges `net.ts:6-7` and `net.ts:205` already treat as
never-allowed, and the reason they matter more for webhooks than for CIMD is that CIMD
URLs come from an OAuth client's own metadata while **webhook URLs come from anyone
holding a token**.

**Closing a gap in the shared policy — decision D16 (§17).** The policy as it stands today
handles IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:169.254.1.1`) but **not** the other IPv6 forms that embed
an IPv4 address: NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`), 6to4 (`2002::/16`), and Teredo. On a DNS64 host, a
name whose A record would be `169.254.169.254` can resolve to `64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe`, which
`isSsrfBlockedResolvedIp()` would treat as an ordinary public address.

As of **D16** these forms are refused, and they belong on the always-blocked list above
alongside the mapped form. This is a **tightening of `lib/net.ts` beyond its current
behavior**, not merely reuse of it, and it is the one place where this RFC asks the shared
policy to change rather than to be called correctly. It is a pre-existing gap rather than one
this design introduces — but webhooks are the first feature that lets an arbitrary token
holder aim the server at an arbitrary name, so the gap stops being theoretical. D16 folded
the fix into PR 1 (§15) rather than a separate hardening card, on the reasoning that a
hardening card filed alongside the feature that needs it tends not to land before the
feature. §14 item 2 tests all three forms.

**The functional cost, recorded because D16 is a decision and this is its price.** Blanket
refusal of `64:ff9b::/96` is not free. On a **DNS64 / IPv6-only** deployment, *every* IPv4
destination is synthesized into that prefix — there is no native IPv4 route at all — so
refusing the whole prefix blocks legitimate public IPv4 webhook targets, not merely internal
ones. An operator on IPv6-only infrastructure would find that no IPv4-hosted consumer can be
subscribed, with a `refused` outcome that looks like an attack rather than a topology.

The narrower alternative is to **extract the embedded IPv4 address and evaluate that** against
the same policy, instead of refusing the prefix outright: `64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe` yields
`169.254.169.254` and is correctly refused, while `64:ff9b::5db8:d822` yields a public address
and is correctly allowed. The same extraction handles 6to4 (`2002::/16`) and Teredo. That is
strictly better security-wise *and* functionally, at the cost of more parsing code in the one
place `net.ts:1` forbids duplicating. D16 stands as ratified; this paragraph records the cost
so the owner can choose extraction over blanket refusal when PR 1 is written, and §16 Q21 asks
the question explicitly.

Note that closing this also benefits the existing CIMD consumer of the same policy, which is
the argument for putting it in `net.ts` rather than in webhook-specific code — and
`net.ts:1`'s no-copying mandate (§9.1) means there is nowhere else correct to put it.

### 9.3 Validation at both ends — the DNS rebinding defense

Validating a URL only at subscription-creation time is the classic rebinding mistake: the
attacker registers `https://hook.example` pointing at a public IP, then changes the DNS
record to `169.254.169.254` before the first delivery.

Therefore:

1. **At creation**, validate the URL statically (§9.5) and resolve the hostname, checking
   every returned A/AAAA record against the policy. Reject before persisting.
2. **At every delivery attempt**, re-validate. Not just at process start, not just at
   creation — every attempt, because DNS records and TTLs are attacker-controlled.
3. **Pin the validated address for the duration of the connection.** Use the
   `pinnedCimdFetcher` technique: a custom `lookup` hook that re-checks each resolved
   address at connect time (`oauth-cimd.ts:406-444`). This closes the
   resolve-then-connect TOCTOU gap, which is the part most webhook implementations get
   wrong even when they do re-validate.
4. If any resolved address is blocked, the outcome is `refused` (§8.2): no connection
   attempt, immediate dead letter, endpoint disabled, audit event.
5. **For `http` targets, additionally require that every pinned address is still private.**
   This is a separate check from step 3 and it is not redundant. An `http` subscription is
   permitted *only because* it resolved to a private address under the escape hatch (§9.5),
   but the ordinary SSRF policy treats **public** addresses as valid — so re-applying that
   policy alone would happily connect. A hostname that was private at creation can later
   resolve publicly, or return a mix of private and public records, and OAE would then
   transmit mail metadata over **plaintext HTTP across the public internet**. So when the
   scheme is `http`, delivery requires *all* resolved addresses to fall inside the permitted
   private ranges; anything else is `refused`. For `https` this extra check is unnecessary,
   since TLS protects the payload regardless of where the address lands.

### 9.4 Redirects

`redirect: 'manual'`, never follow — the existing `redirect_forbidden` behavior of the CIMD
document-fetch wrapper (`oauth-cimd.ts:526`, `:543`), promoted into shared policy per §9.1.
A 3xx response is a **permanent** failure (§8.2).

Following a redirect re-enters DNS resolution on a new host that was never validated,
which is a complete bypass of §9.3 in one hop. It also lets a public endpoint bounce OAE
into the internal network. If redirect support is ever added, each hop must be
independently re-validated and re-pinned, and the hop count bounded; that is a separate
design decision, not a flag.

### 9.5 URL acceptance rules at creation

| Rule | Rationale / precedent |
| --- | --- |
| `https` only, with system trust store | Payload may contain mail metadata going to a third party. |
| **No insecure-TLS escape hatch** | The repo has `IMAP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` and `SMTP_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`, but those govern connections to the operator's *own* mail server. A webhook target is a third party; a `WEBHOOK_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` flag would exist only to be misused. Refused deliberately. |
| `http` permitted only when the target resolves to an allowed private address **and** `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true` | Covers loopback/tailnet deployments and the same-host case #109 asks for, without a general plaintext path. |
| No userinfo, no query, no fragment | Precedent: the `DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_URL` refinement (`config.ts:64`). Userinfo in a URL is a credential-leak vector and a parsing-ambiguity vector; a query string is a place secrets get logged. |
| Hostname must be a DNS name, not an IP literal | An IP literal bypasses DNS pinning entirely — there is no resolution step to intercept. Allowed only under the private-target exception, where the operator is explicitly asserting the address is safe. |
| Port in `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_PORTS` (default `443`) | Non-standard ports are how SSRF reaches internal admin panels. Comma-separated list, `splitCsv` convention. |
| Total subscriptions capped | §8.7. |

### 9.6 The compose-internal threat, concretely

OAE ships `compose.yaml` and `compose.api-only.yaml`, and ntfy is reached at
`NTFY_INTERNAL_URL` (default `http://ntfy`) — a Docker service name resolving to a
private address on the compose network. Without §9.2–§9.3, an actor holding **any**
identity-scoped token could register `http://ntfy/<topic>` and make the OAE process issue
requests into the internal network with the process's own network position: reaching ntfy,
the mail server's management interfaces, or anything else on that network.

The private-address block covers this, and `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true` (`config.ts:214`)
removes the exception entirely for internet-facing deployments. This is the specific
scenario that makes §9 non-optional, and it should appear in the security documentation
as a worked example.

### 9.7 Egress amplification

OAE must not be usable as a DDoS reflector or a port scanner:

- Response reads capped at `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES` (§6.6) and discarded.
- **An absolute wall-clock deadline per attempt, independent of socket activity.** This is
  *not* the same thing as the existing timeout, and reusing it unchanged leaves a hole:
  `pinnedCimdFetcher()` implements its timeout with Node's `req.setTimeout()`
  (`oauth-cimd.ts:474-476`), which is **inactivity-based**. A hostile endpoint that sends one
  response byte just before each idle expiry never triggers it and can hold a delivery slot
  for hours while staying under the byte cap. Enough such endpoints pin the entire
  instance-wide pool (§8.7) and starve every other subscription — a denial of service against
  OAE's own push subsystem, mounted by a URL someone registered. Webhook delivery therefore
  carries an independent timer that destroys the request at `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`
  after the attempt **starts**, regardless of activity, in addition to any inactivity timeout.
  PR 1's generalization of the fetcher (§15) must add it; this is the one capability the
  shared transport needs that CIMD never did.
- Per-endpoint and instance-wide concurrency caps (§8.7). With the absolute deadline above, a
  tarpit that accepts TCP and never responds occupies exactly one slot for
  `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` and then fails — without it, the cap alone does not bound
  anything.
- Circuit breaker (§8.5) stops sustained traffic to a failing target.
- Registration rate limited, **and creation-triggered pings charged to the same per-token
  probe bucket as `POST /:id/test`** (§8.7). Otherwise the create rate becomes the probe rate:
  a stolen identity token deletes and recreates subscriptions 10× a minute, each firing an
  asynchronous `webhook.ping` (§5.1), and obtains at least ten triggers a minute — while
  reading `state` and `lastDelivery` to observe the outcome. Bounding only `/test` and not the
  ping it triggers bounds nothing. The bucket counts **triggers**, and since each ping runs up
  to three attempts the honest egress ceiling is ~9 connections/minute per token (§8.7, §12.5).
- Delivery attempts to a `refused` target are never retried (§8.2).

## 10. Configuration surface

### 10.1 Environment variables

Following the repo's conventions exactly: SCREAMING_SNAKE, `WEBHOOK_` namespace,
`z.enum(['true','false'])` for booleans, `0` disables a numeric limit, `envUrl()` for
URLs, defaults inline in the schema.

| Variable | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` | `'true' \| 'false'` | `'false'` | Fail-closed, matching `NTFY_ENABLED` and `TASK_LEASES_ENABLED`. When false, all `/v1/webhooks` routes return `404`. |
| `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` | string ≥ 32, optional | unset | When unset, keys are derived from `taskSigningSecret` (§12.1). When set, it is the derivation root instead. |
| `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET_PREVIOUS` | string ≥ 32, optional | unset | The prior root, used **only** to emit a second `v1=` signature during overlapped root rotation (§12.2). Read at boot, never persisted, cleared by the operator when the window closes. |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | `'true' \| 'false'` | `'false'` | The escape hatch #109 asks for. **Overridden to false when `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true`** — a public edge wins, and this precedence must be enforced in `parseConfig`, not left to the operator. Even when on, private targets are **admin-only** to create or update (§10.4 Rule C), so enabling one same-host callback does not hand every identity token an internal-network oracle. |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_PORTS` | CSV of ints | `443` | `splitCsv` convention. |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS` | int ≥ 0 | `16` | |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_PER_ADDRESS` | int ≥ 0 | `4` | |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | int 1–**11** | `11` | Truncates the fixed 72 h schedule in §8.3. `1` = no retry; `4` = the perishability-only front half; `8` gives a **+20 h** horizon — note this is *not* the ~27 h budget this document originally recommended, because §8.3 now lists cumulative offsets and attempt 8 sits at +20 h. **Upper-bounded at 11** because §8.3 defines exactly eleven offsets; a larger value would have no defined attempt times, so it is a schema error rather than something to extrapolate. |
| `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | int ≥ 1000 | `10000` | Matches `CIMD_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` and GitHub's published 10 s. |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_CONCURRENT` | int ≥ 1 | `8` | Mirrors `MAX_WAITS_TOTAL`, separate pool. |
| `WEBHOOK_POOL_RETRY_MS` | int ≥ 1000 | `5000` | Reschedule delay when the concurrency pool is full, which yields no `retryAfterSec` (§8.2). Floored so it cannot be configured into a spin. |
| `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | int ≥ 2048 | `16384` | **Cannot be disabled** (§8.7). |
| `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_BYTES` | int ≥ 0 | `4096` | `preview` scope only (§6.3). `0` omits `actionArguments` entirely. |
| `WEBHOOK_APPROVAL_ARGS_MAX_DEPTH` | int ≥ 1 | `4` | Below the task API's own depth 10 (§6.6). |
| `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES` | int ≥ 1 | `4096` | **Cannot be disabled** (§8.7) — `0` would mean an unlimited read. |
| `WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC` | int ≥ 30 | `300` | Consumer-side value, published in docs and in `GET /v1/webhooks`. |
| `WEBHOOK_DISABLE_THRESHOLD` | int ≥ 1 | `10` | Consecutive **failed attempts** per endpoint, reset to 0 on any success (**D2a**, §8.5). `deferred` does not count. |
| `WEBHOOK_ROTATION_OVERLAP_MS` | int ≥ 0 | `86400000` | 24 h dual-signature window (§12.2). `0` = atomic swap. |
| `WEBHOOK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | int ≥ **4** | `30` | **Floor is tied to the retry horizon, not to taste.** D2's schedule runs to +72 h, so a retention window under 4 days would let daily compaction delete the only durable record of a pending attempt *before that attempt is due* — silently dropping attempts 9–11 and with them the whole tail the extension bought. Enforced in the schema, and it must be re-checked if the schedule is ever lengthened. |
| `WEBHOOK_RATE_CREATE_PER_MIN` | int ≥ 0 | `10` | |
| `WEBHOOK_RATE_TEST_PER_MIN` | int ≥ 0 | `3` | Per token, separate bucket from delivery (§8.7). Bounds caller-triggered egress. |
| `WEBHOOK_RATE_DELIVER_PER_MIN` | int ≥ 0 | `60` | Per endpoint. `0` disables. |

Note what is **absent**: no `WEBHOOK_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` (§9.5), and no per-event-type
env configuration — event selection belongs to the subscription, not the environment.

### 10.2 Boot-time validation

All of these run in `parseConfig` and fail the boot, following the existing
`ALWAYS_BCC` precedent (`config.ts:262-280`). A misconfigured webhook subsystem must not
start and silently misbehave:

1. If `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=true`, then `TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` **must be explicitly set** and
   ≥ 32 characters — **unconditionally, whether or not `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is also
   set**. The `SMTP_PASS` fallback is refused. Rationale in §12.1.

   This rule was conditional in the first draft (it applied only when
   `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` was unset), and review caught that the condition was a hole.
   Setting `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` protects the *webhook signature* key, but it does
   nothing for `data.cursor`: the cursor embedded in every `mail.received` payload is a
   `mail-cursor-v1` HMAC keyed on `config.taskSigningSecret` (`imap.ts:765`, `:833`,
   `mail-cursor.ts:39-45`), and its signed plaintext is
   `mail-cursor-v1\n<folder>\n<address>\n<receivedAtMs>\n<uid>` — of which folder, address
   and `receivedAtMs` are all visible elsewhere in the same payload, leaving only the small
   integer `uid` to guess. That is a **known-plaintext MAC over the root key, handed to a
   third party on every delivery**. If `taskSigningSecret` had silently fallen back to
   `SMTP_PASS`, any webhook consumer could brute-force the SMTP password offline. This is
   the exact oracle `mail-stamp.ts:141` exists to prevent, arriving by a second path the
   first draft did not check.
2. If `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true`, `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` is forced to `false`.
3. `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_PORTS` must be non-empty and contain only integers in 1–65535. The
   real protection against reaching an internal management panel is the address policy
   (§9.1–§9.3), not the port list; the port list exists to stop non-standard ports being
   used casually, and this RFC does not pretend it does more.
4. `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` must be ≤ `JSON_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`.
5. `DATA_DIR` must be writable, as existing stores already require.

### 10.3 REST API

Mounted as `app.route('/v1/webhooks', webhooksRoute)` alongside the existing mounts
(`app.ts:104-116`), therefore behind `bearerAuth` and the pre-auth `bodyLimit`. Bare
objects on success, `201` on create, `{error:'snake_case'}` on failure, zod `.strict()`
bodies.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks` | admin, or identity for own address — **never OAuth** (§10.4) | Create. `201` + `secret`. Accepts the same optional `Idempotency-Key` header as `rotate` (§12.2): a retry with a seen key returns the stored `201` response with `secret: null` plus the `id`, and does **not** create a second subscription. Without this, losing the `201` — a network drop, a client crash — left an identity caller with no recoverable key *and* made its natural retry consume another slot of the per-address cap (§8.7), so two lost responses could exhaust the cap with orphaned subscriptions. Recovery of the key itself is `GET …/secret` (§12.3). |
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks` | admin: all; identity: own address | `{webhooks:[…]}`. Never includes `secret`. |
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks/:id` | as above | Bare object incl. `state`, `lastDelivery`. |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/:id` | as above | Update `url` / `events` / `contentScope` / `description`. POST, not PUT/PATCH, matching `POST /v1/tasks/:id/state`. **A `url` change re-runs the full §9.5 static validation and §9.3 resolution check before persisting**, returning `invalid_webhook_url` or `webhook_target_forbidden`. When `url` changes, `consecutiveFailures` is reset to 0, `state` transitions to `unverified` (except when manually `disabled`, which remains `disabled`), and a new asynchronous creation ping probe is fired to test the new target endpoint (Item 7). |
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks/:id/secret` | admin, or the identity that **created** it, `metadata` scope only (§10.4 Rule D, §12.3) | Re-display the current derived signing key. Audited as `webhook.reveal`. Possible only because D6 chose derivation. **Must return `Cache-Control: no-store`** (and no `ETag`): the body is long-lived key material, and a shared cache, browser history, or intermediary log retaining it would undo the entire secret-handling model. |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/webhooks/:id` | admin, or the identity that **created** it and only at `metadata` scope (§10.4 Rules B + D) | Delete the subscription **and cancel its pending retries**, marking any not-yet-attempted rows `permanent` with reason `subscription_deleted` so the log still accounts for them. Precedent: `routes/notify.ts:228`. Identity deletion cascades the same way (§10.5). |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/:id/rotate` | admin, or the identity that **created** it and only at `metadata` scope (§10.4 Rules B + D) | Increment the derivation `epoch`; start the overlap window (§12.2). Returns the new `secret`. `409 rotation_window_open` if a window is already open, unless `force`. |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/:id/test` | as above | Fire `webhook.ping` and return once the first attempt settles, bounded by `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` (10 s). Responds `{deliveryId, outcome, status, reason}`. Later attempts continue in the background. **`status` is `null` whenever no HTTP response was received** — DNS failure, connection refused, TLS handshake error, and timeout all produce an `outcome` with no status code, so the field must be nullable and `reason` carries the machine-readable cause (`dns_error`, `connection_refused`, `tls_error`, `timeout`, `ssrf_refused`, or `null` on success). Promising a `status` unconditionally, as an earlier draft did, would force an implementation to invent one. **On a `disabled` endpoint this returns `409 {error:'webhook_disabled', disabledReason}` and fires nothing** — §8.5 suppresses all delivery while disabled, so a route that promised to deliver and await would either contradict the state machine or silently dead-letter a ping the caller is waiting on. Note the asymmetry this creates and accept it deliberately: an identity token may call `/test` but **not** `/enable` (admin-only), so an identity that disabled its own subscription cannot probe it back to life without an admin. That is correct — `/enable` after a `threshold` or `refused` disablement is meant to require a human look (§8.5) — but it must be documented, since the obvious client flow "pause, fix, test, resume" needs an admin for the resume step. |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/:id/disable` | as above (own address) | Manual pause. Sets `state: "disabled"`, `disabledReason: "manual"`. Reversible by `/enable` without investigation. |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/:id/enable` | admin | Clear `disabled` state, reset the counter (§8.5). |
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries` | admin | `{deliveries:[…], nextCursor}` — recent attempts and dead letters, from the JSONL log. |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/deliveries/:deliveryId/redeliver` | admin | Manual replay of one recorded delivery — **dead letter or success**, per decision **D15** (§17), following Resend's "replay both `failed` and `succeeded`". Enqueues a fresh attempt with a **new** `deliveryId`, the **same** event `id`, and a `replay: true` marker in the log row. Replaying a success re-sends an event the consumer already processed, so it leans on their `id` dedupe (§8.1); the marker exists so an operator reading the log can tell a replay from an original. |

Create and update request validation rules:
- `events`: must be a non-empty array of unique event types (`events.length >= 1`, duplicate entries rejected with `invalid_request`, Item 8).
- `description`: optional human-readable string up to 1000 characters (`<= 1000 chars`, Item 4).
- `contentScope`: `'metadata'` (default) or `'preview'` (admin-only).

Create request:

```json
{
  "url": "https://consumer.example.com/hooks/oae",
  "address": "postmaster@openagent.email",
  "events": ["mail.received", "approval.requested"],
  "contentScope": "metadata",
  "description": "postmaster wake-up + approval paging"
}
```

Create response (`201`):

```json
{
  "id": "whk_4a1b8c2d-5e6f-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d",
  "url": "https://consumer.example.com/hooks/oae",

  "timestampToleranceSec": 300,
  "createdAt": "2026-09-03T12:20:00.000Z"
}
```

`GET` responses replace `secret` with `secretPrefix` only. The prefix exists so an
operator can tell two endpoints apart in a list and correlate with their own secret store
without OAE keeping the plaintext (§12.1).

### 10.4 Authorization model

| Actor | May do |
| --- | --- |
| admin key | Everything, on any address: create/update/delete/rotate/test/enable, list deliveries, redeliver, set `contentScope: preview`. |
| identity token (`oa_…`, address-scoped) | Create/update/delete/rotate/test subscriptions **for its own address only**, at `contentScope: metadata` only. Cannot list deliveries or redeliver. |
| oauth token | Reads, and deleting its own subscriptions. **Creation is refused on every surface** — see the enforcement note below. Never admin (`auth.ts`). |

Enforcement reuses `forbidUnlessAddress()` and `requireAdmin()` — no new auth primitive for
address scoping. **But OAuth restriction does need one, and this is worth being precise
about because the obvious mechanism does not work.**

`bearerAuth` deliberately collapses an OAuth access token to an identity-scoped
`Auth` (`{kind:'identity', address}`), so a route calling `getAuth(c)` **cannot tell an
OAuth token from a native identity token**. The `critical` MCP tier (§10.7) is enforced on
the MCP path only; it has no effect on a direct `POST /v1/webhooks`. Relying on the tier to
make creation deny-by-default for OAuth would therefore leave the REST route granting the
persistent egress capability the tier was chosen to withhold.

The distinction is available one level up: `TokenAttribution` (`auth.ts:45-48`) carries
`{kind:'oauth', address, grantId, clientId}` alongside `Auth`, and the resolver returns both
(`auth.ts:67`). So the normative rule is:

> **Rule A — OAuth exclusion covers every mutation, not just create.**
> Every mutating webhook route must consult **token attribution**, not `Auth`, and reject
> `kind === 'oauth'`. In v1 that set is: `POST /v1/webhooks`, `POST /v1/webhooks/:id`,
> `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/rotate`, `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test`, and
> `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/disable`. Stated as "every mutation" rather than as that list,
> because enumerating is exactly how `/disable` was omitted when R35 added it — a new
> mutating route inherits this rule by default and must be explicitly exempted if it ever
> should be. The MCP tier is a second, independent gate on the MCP path — not the mechanism
> that makes REST safe. Covering only create and rotate (as the first draft did) would let an
> OAuth token still redirect an existing subscription via update, pause or resume it, or
> originate probe connections via `test`, which is precisely what the row above excludes.
> Error: `403 {error:'forbidden: oauth tokens may not mutate webhook subscriptions'}`.
>
> **This rule also settles the MCP side, and §14 item 7 previously contradicted it.** An
> earlier draft of the test list required `mail_webhook_test` to be *permitted* for an
> OAuth-derived token while Rule A forbade the same operation over REST. Since the MCP tool
> and the REST route perform the identical action, that was an OAuth bypass through the MCP
> door. `mail_webhook_test` is tier `contained` (§10.7), which is not deny-by-default for
> OAuth, so the tool must apply the same attribution check the route does. Corrected in
> §14 item 7.

> **Rule B — validate the *resulting* subscription, not just the requested fields.**
> An identity token may update a subscription it owns, but the update must be evaluated
> against the post-update state. Concretely: if the stored `contentScope` is `preview`, an
> identity token may **not** change `url` at all. Otherwise an admin creates a `preview`
> subscription (correctly, since `preview` is admin-only) and the address's own identity token
> then edits *only* the URL, leaving `contentScope: preview` intact — silently redirecting
> mail previews and approval arguments to an attacker-chosen endpoint and defeating the
> admin-only rule completely. The alternatives are to reject the update
> (`403 {error:'content_scope_requires_admin'}`) or to force a downgrade to `metadata` when an
> identity token changes `url`; **rejecting is recommended**, because a silent downgrade would
> break the operator's integration without telling them.
>
> **The same rule covers `rotate` and `DELETE`, which the first version of this rule missed.**
> Rotating an admin-created `preview` subscription hands the identity caller a *fresh signing
> key* for an endpoint whose scope it was never permitted to set, and simultaneously
> invalidates the key the admin's consumer is verifying with — key material it should not
> hold, plus a denial of service on an integration it does not own. Deleting it removes an
> admin's paging path. Therefore an identity token may rotate and delete only subscriptions
> whose `contentScope` is `metadata`; on a `preview` subscription both require an admin key.
> The general form of the rule is what matters: **authorization is a function of the
> subscription's stored state, not only of the fields the request names.**

> **Rule C — private targets are admin-only, and the grant must be persisted and re-checked at
> delivery.** When `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true` (§9.5), creating or updating a
> subscription whose target resolves to a private, loopback, CGNAT, or ULA address requires an
> **admin key**. Without this, an operator enabling one legitimate same-host callback would

> oracle against internal services. An operator-controlled host allowlist is the stronger
> alternative and is §16 Q18.
>
> **A creation-time check alone is not sufficient, and this is the subtle part.** An identity
> token can create a subscription while its hostname honestly resolves to a *public* address —

> identity-created subscription would be waved through into the internal network.
>
> So the grant is per-subscription and durable: `webhooks.json` records

> its target resolved private at that moment (§10.5). Delivery then requires, for any resolved

> private address without the grant is `refused` — dead-letter, disable, audit as
> `webhook.ssrf_refused` (§8.2, §9.3 step 3). The rule reduces to: *the global setting says

> subscription was authorized for one.* Neither alone is sufficient, and §14 item 2 tests the
> rebind-without-grant case specifically.

> **Rule D — secret-bearing and destructive operations are scoped by *creator*, not by

Everything else in the table is enforceable with the existing primitives.

**Why an identity token may subscribe at all.** This is the capability that makes #109's
flagship use case work: an agent can wire up its own wake-up endpoint without a human
holding the admin key. It is safe because the token is already scoped to one address, and
everything it can subscribe to is mail it can already read via `GET /v1/messages`. The
scope table is the containment: metadata-only means a stolen identity token gains
*convenience*, not *content*.

Delivery inspection and redelivery are admin-only because the delivery log is an
instance-wide operational artifact, consistent with `GET /v1/audit/events`
(`routes/audit.ts:18`).

### 10.5 Storage

**`DATA_DIR/webhooks.json`** — subscription registry, following every existing store
convention (§3.6): 0600 in a 0700 directory, single writer, atomic `.tmp` + rename,
fsync, corrupt-fails-closed, and a `FORBIDDEN_SECRET_KEYS`-style guard
(`notification-devices.ts:112`) extended to refuse persisting `secret`, `signingSecret`,
or `previousSecret`.

Per subscription the file holds: `id`, `url`, `address`, `events`, `contentScope`,
`description`, `state`, `disabledReason`, `secretPrefix`, **`epoch`**, **`overlapUntil`**,
`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `rotatedAt`, **`consecutiveFailures`**, **`privateTargetGranted`**,
`createdBy` (`admin` or the address).

`privateTargetGranted` is set only when an admin created or updated the subscription and its
target resolved private at that moment; delivery requires it, in addition to the global escape
hatch, before connecting to any private address (§10.4 Rule C). It is what stops a DNS rebind
on an identity-created subscription from riding an admin's escape hatch into the internal
network.

**There is deliberately no `active` boolean.** An earlier draft carried one alongside `state`,
and review correctly noted it had no defined semantics: with a three-value `state` (§8.5) whose
`disabled` already suppresses delivery, a second on/off flag has no answer for
`active: false, state: "enabled"`, and two overlapping suppression switches guarantee that an
implementer picks one and an operator reads the other. One field, with `disabledReason`
recording *why*, expresses everything: `"manual"` (operator pause via `POST …/disable`),
`"threshold"` (circuit breaker, §8.5), or `"refused"` (SSRF, §9.3). Recovery differs by
reason, which is exactly the information a boolean would have thrown away.

`description` is persisted because the create contract accepts it (§10.3); a field the API
takes and then discards is worse than one it refuses, since the operator's label silently
vanishes on the next restart and multiple endpoints become indistinguishable.

**Deleting an identity must cascade to its subscriptions.** `deleteIdentity()` today removes
the identity and cascades OAuth grants (`identities.ts`), and this design adds webhook
cleanup to that cascade: deleting an address hard-deletes **all** subscriptions owned by it
from `webhooks.json`, writes a `webhook.delete` audit event for each, and cancels their pending retry
attempts in `deliveryQueue` with reason `subscription_deleted` (Item 6). Without this, subscriptions
keyed by address survive the identity, and if the same address is later recreated the old
callback silently resumes receiving the *new* identity's mail — a durable exfiltration channel
that outlives the credential it was created under, and one nobody would think to look for.
This is the same reason OAuth grants are already cascaded rather than orphaned.

Three of those fields exist only because of decisions made elsewhere in this document, and
omitting any of them breaks something non-obvious:

- **`epoch`** (integer, starts at 0) is the derivation input §12.1 requires. Without it
  persisted, the signing key cannot be re-derived after a rotation *and* a restart, so a
  rotated endpoint would silently revert to its pre-rotation key and every consumer that had
  migrated would start failing verification. This is the field review caught missing from the
  first draft of this list.
- **`overlapUntil`** (timestamp or null) is what tells the signer to emit two signatures
  (§12.2). It is derived state, but it must survive a restart or a rotation in progress would
  end early and cut consumers off mid-window.
- **`consecutiveFailures`** is the circuit-breaker counter — consecutive failed attempts,
  reset to 0 on any success, per **D2a** (§8.5). It must survive a restart, or a crash would
  silently clear a disabled endpoint's counter and a restart would resume hammering an
  endpoint the breaker had already condemned.

Rotation idempotency keys (§12.2) are stored alongside, keyed by `(webhookId,
idempotencyKey)` with the resulting `epoch` and response body, retained for
`WEBHOOK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`. They contain no secret: the response body they cache does
include the revealed key, so this entry is subject to the same `FORBIDDEN_SECRET_KEYS`
guard as everything else in the file — which means the **stored response must redact the
secret** and a replayed rotation returns `200` with `secret: null` plus the `epoch`, forcing
the operator to use the admin re-display path (§12.3) if they lost it. Trading a little
convenience for not persisting a plaintext secret is the right side of §12.1's argument.

Note what the file does **not** hold: the signing secret (§12.1), any payload content, or the
delivery history (that is the JSONL log, §8.6).

`identities.ts:12` observes that the JSON-store approach should be swapped for SQLite
"if identity volume ever matters". The same applies here, and at 16 subscriptions it does
not matter.

### 10.6 Audit events

Written through `recordAuditEvent()` (never throws), using the existing whitelist — which
means **no URLs, no payloads, no secrets, no subjects can appear in the audit log by
construction**. That is a feature: the audit log is the one artifact an operator is most
likely to ship elsewhere.

**One extension to the whitelist is required.** `AuditEvent` (`audit.ts:38-50`) has no field
identifying *which* subscription a management mutation targeted — it carries `address`, but
§8.7 permits up to four subscriptions per address, so a `webhook.delete` against one of four
would be indistinguishable from the other three. Add an optional **`webhookId`** to the
whitelist, populated on every `webhook.*` event. It is an opaque identifier rather than
content, so it does not weaken the property that makes the whitelist valuable, and it turns
the log from "someone changed a webhook on this address" into something an incident review can
use. It is also the join key against the delivery log (§8.6). `scrubAuditField()` applies to it
as to every other field, and `recordAuditEvent()` still never throws.

| `event` | `outcome` values |
| --- | --- |
| `webhook.create` / `webhook.update` / `webhook.delete` | `ok`, `denied`, `rate_limited`, `error` |
| `webhook.rotate` | `ok`, `denied`, `error` |
| `webhook.reveal` | `ok`, `denied` — secret re-display (§12.3), creator-scoped per Rule D. Audited because it is the one route that returns keying material, and because a `denied` here is an attempted privilege escalation worth seeing |
| `webhook.disabled` / `webhook.enabled` | `ok` — **state transitions only** |
| `webhook.deliver` | **not audited** — see below |
| `webhook.ssrf_refused` | `denied` |

**Per-attempt delivery outcomes must not go to the audit log.** An earlier draft listed
`webhook.deliver` here, and the arithmetic makes that untenable: `audit.jsonl` rotates at
`AUDIT_ROTATE_BYTES = 10 MiB` into a **single** `.1` backup (`audit.ts:29`, `:80-97`), so the
whole audit history is about 20 MiB. At the configured ceilings — 16 endpoints
(`WEBHOOK_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`) × 60 deliveries/minute (`WEBHOOK_RATE_DELIVER_PER_MIN`) — one
row per attempt is up to ~960 rows a minute, or on the order of 100 MB a day. That evicts the
authentication denials, grant revocations, and admin mutations the audit log exists to
preserve, within hours, and it does so precisely on a busy instance where that history matters
most. Turning a security log into a delivery log is a self-inflicted loss of evidence.

So the split is explicit:

- **Delivery attempts** — every outcome, including `success`, `retryable`, `permanent`,
  `deferred` — go **only** to `webhook-deliveries.jsonl` (§8.6), which has its own 30-day
  retention and its own inspection API. That file is *designed* for this volume.
- **The audit log** keeps only what an auditor needs: management mutations (create, update,
  delete, rotate, reveal, disable, enable), disablement transitions, and SSRF refusals. All
  are low-frequency and operator-initiated.

`webhook.ssrf_refused` stays in the audit log even though it originates in the delivery path,
because it is a security event rather than a delivery outcome, and it is rare by construction —
it disables the endpoint immediately (§8.5), so it cannot recur at volume for one subscription.

`webhook.ssrf_refused` is the one that matters for security review: it is the signal that
someone tried to point OAE at an internal address. When triggered in the context of an HTTP request
(such as `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test`), it carries `address` and `ip` (client IP via `clientIp(c)`).
For asynchronous background deliveries where there is no HTTP client context, `ip` is omitted (`null`/undefined, Item 3),
and target internals are never leaked.

### 10.7 MCP surface parity

`CONTRIBUTING.md` states a rule this design cannot ignore: *"Keep the REST contract and the
MCP tool surface in sync — every REST operation has a `mail_*` tool and vice versa."*

**The rule already has an exception, and it is the relevant one.** Admin-only operational
routes have no MCP counterpart today: `GET /v1/audit/events` and the
`POST|GET|DELETE /v1/notify/devices` family appear nowhere in `mcp/tools.ts`, while
agent-facing routes all do. So parity applies to the **agent-facing** surface, not to
instance administration.

Applying that line to §10.3:

| Route | MCP tool | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/webhooks` | `mail_webhook_list` | `read` |
| `POST /v1/webhooks` | `mail_webhook_create` | **`critical`** |
| `DELETE /v1/webhooks/:id` | `mail_webhook_delete` | `minimal` |
| `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test` | `mail_webhook_test` | `contained` |
| `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/disable` | `mail_webhook_disable` | `minimal` |
| `GET /v1/webhooks/:id`, `POST /v1/webhooks/:id`, `POST …/rotate`, `GET …/secret` | **none in v1** — see below | — |
| `POST …/enable`, `GET …/deliveries`, `POST …/redeliver` | none — admin-only, existing exception | — |

Two of these rows were added after D17 was approved and needed re-deciding rather than
inheriting:

- **`mail_webhook_disable` is added, tier `minimal`.** An agent that can create and delete its
  own subscription can coherently pause it, and pausing is strictly less capable than deleting
  — refusing it would push agents toward delete-and-recreate, which is worse (it burns the
  per-address cap, loses the derivation `epoch`, and triggers a fresh creation ping against the
  §8.7 probe budget). `minimal` matches `mail_mark_seen` and `task_create`: a lightweight state
  change with no external effect. It is subject to Rule D — an identity may pause only what it
  created.
- **`GET /v1/webhooks/:id/secret` deliberately gets no tool.** This is the one identity-reachable
  operation left REST-only, and the reason is blast radius rather than parity: an MCP tool that
  returns signing-key material puts that key into an agent's context, where it can be echoed
  into a model transcript, a tool-call log, or a prompt-injected response. The REST route
  requires a caller to deliberately fetch and handle a secret; a tool makes it available to
  anything the agent can be persuaded to call. Recovery from a lost `rotate` response (§12.3)
  is rare and operator-shaped, so keeping it off the agent surface costs little. This extends
  D17's accepted deviation list from three routes to four, and §16 Q17 records it.

That makes **five** MCP tools rather than the four D17 approved — a change to a ratified
decision, flagged here and in §17 rather than made silently.

Tiers use the existing four-level vocabulary in `lib/tool-tiers.ts` (`read` / `minimal` /
`contained` / `critical`), whose definitions are quoted here in translation: `contained` is
*outbound or wake* (send mail, notify, advance a task) and `critical` is *identity creation
and human-verification channels, deny-by-default for OAuth tickets*.

**Why `mail_webhook_create` is `critical` and not `contained`.** `mail_send` is `contained`
because it is a single outbound act. Creating a webhook is worse in kind: it installs a
**persistent** egress target that OAE will connect to on every future mail, at a URL the
caller chose. That is closer to `mail_new_identity` (which mints a lasting credential) than
to `mail_send`. The practical consequence is the one that matters — under the repo's
existing tier policy, `critical` is deny-by-default for OAuth-derived tokens, so an agent
acting on a narrowly-granted OAuth ticket cannot silently register a callback URL. It can
still do so with an identity bearer token, which is the capability §10.4 deliberately
grants. `mail_webhook_test` is `contained` because it causes exactly one outbound
connection now.

This also **sharpens §10.4**: an OAuth token maps to identity scope for *reads* and for
`mail_webhook_delete`, but webhook **creation** should be deny-by-default for OAuth tickets
via the tier policy rather than allowed merely because the token is identity-scoped. The
tier mechanism already exists to express this; no new auth primitive is needed.

**The deviation, stated for ratification.** `GET /v1/webhooks/:id`, `POST /v1/webhooks/:id`
(update), and `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/rotate` are not admin-only, so strict parity would
require three more tools. v1 omits them: an agent needs to wire up, verify, list, and tear
down its own wake-up endpoint, and it does not need to edit filters or rotate signing keys
from inside the agent loop. MCP tools are effectively permanent once shipped — removing one
breaks every client that adopted it — so the surface should start minimal and grow on
demand. This is a deliberate, visible deviation from the CONTRIBUTING rule rather than an
oversight, and §16 Q17 asks the owner to ratify or reject it.

Two mechanical notes for implementation: `assertToolTierDeclared()` (`tool-tiers.ts:73`)
throws at registration if a tool is registered without a declared tier, so a missing tier
cannot ship silently; and `TOOL_TIER_SPEC` (`tool-tiers.ts:28`) is documented as the single
source shared by PRs and docs, so the four rows above must be added there in the same PR.

### 10.8 Dashboard surface (read-only)

Decision **D4** (§17) reversed this document's original "no new UI" non-goal. v1 ships a
**read-only** panel under Configure, aligned with the Configure section ADR-0026 already
plans, and deliberately mirroring the existing notification-log view rather than inventing a
new idiom.

**Routes.** Following the established `/ui/api/*` mirror pattern — the cookie-session
counterpart of a bearer route, as `/ui/api/notify/messages` mirrors `/v1/notify/messages`:

| Route | Mirrors | Session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /ui/api/webhooks` | `GET /v1/webhooks` | admin sees all; identity session sees its own address |
| `GET /ui/api/webhooks/summary` | — (new) | **admin only**; counts by state and by outcome |
| `GET /ui/api/webhooks/:id` | `GET /v1/webhooks/:id` | admin sees all; identity session sees its own address |
| `GET /ui/api/webhooks/:id/deliveries` | `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries` | **admin only** |

**Registration order is load-bearing: `/summary` must be registered before `/:id`.** In the
order listed above, Hono would otherwise match `/ui/api/webhooks/summary` against
`/ui/api/webhooks/:id` with `id = "summary"`, so the summary endpoint would return a
detail-route `not_found` instead of counts — a silent failure that looks like a data problem
rather than a routing one. The existing router already defends against exactly this: it
registers static message subroutes before `/:id` (`routes/ui.ts:767`), and `app.ts` carries a
comment that shell deep links must come last so they do not swallow dedicated routes. The same
discipline applies here, and §14 item 12 tests it by requesting `/summary` and asserting
counts rather than a 404.

All four are GET, so they pass through the existing UI gate untouched: `requireUiOrigin` and
`uiSessionBodyLimit` guard *writes* and let GET/HEAD/OPTIONS through (`app.ts` UI block).
That is precisely why the panel is read-only — adding one mutating route would pull the
cookie-session surface into the secret-handling paths, and §2.2 refuses that.

**What it shows.** Three things, in this order, because the ordering is the diagnosis path:

1. **Subscriptions**, with `state` (`unverified` / `enabled` / `disabled`), `disabledReason`,
   `events`, `contentScope`, `address`, and `lastDelivery`. A disabled endpoint is visually
   distinct, not a neutral row — this is the "fail visible" requirement (§13) reaching the
   operator who is not reading logs.
2. **Deliveries and dead letters** for one subscription: `ts`, `type`, `attempt`, `outcome`,
   `status`, `durationMs`, `replay`. Newest first, cursor-paginated, filterable by outcome.
   Never any payload content, because the log never stores any (§8.6).
3. **Summary counts** — endpoints by state, deliveries by outcome over the retention window,
   dead-letter total. One data source for both the panel and the health signal (§13), so the
   two cannot disagree, which is the same rule ADR-0026 applies to its notification summary.

**What it must not show.** The signing secret, in any form, including the derived-key
re-display discussed in §12.1 — `secretPrefix` only. There is no rotate, delete, enable, or
redeliver button. An operator who wants those uses the REST API with an admin key, which is
the correct place for an action that changes what the server will connect to.

**Implementation constraints inherited from `/ui`.** No build step: CSS is a template string
in `packages/api/src/ui/assets.ts` (`UI_CSS`), so a new panel means editing that file, not
adding a bundler. `UI_ENABLED=false` must 404 these routes exactly as it does every other
`/ui` route. Visual tokens come from the shared `:root` set that DESIGN.md pins to the
website repo — a new panel introduces no new colors. And the honest-status copy rule from
DESIGN.md applies: a failed refresh says so and keeps the old rows rather than showing an
empty table that looks like "no deliveries".

## 11. Coexistence with `mail_wait_for`

### 11.1 What long-polling is today

Facts, cited, because the coexistence argument depends on them:

- MCP tool `mail_wait_for` (`packages/api/src/mcp/tools.ts:383`), inputs `address`,
  `fromContains`, `subjectContains`, `timeoutSec` (1–600, default 120). Tier `read`.
- Backed by `POST /v1/messages/wait` (`routes/messages.ts:78`), auth via
  `forbidUnlessAddress`.
- The requested timeout is **silently clamped** to `MCP_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`
  (`clampWaitSeconds()`, `config.ts:352`; default 60, schema max 600), and the effective
  value is echoed in `X-OAE-Wait-Timeout-Sec`.
- Implementation is `waitForMessage()` → `waitWithIdle()`: one IMAP connection held with
  a mailbox lock, looping `findMatchWith()` then racing `client.idle()` against a 3 s
  heartbeat; on IDLE failure it degrades to `waitWithPolling()` at 3 s intervals.
- For an ordinary mail wait, `findMatchWith()` pages the **newest 20** inbox messages
  (`imap.ts:1013`) and returns the newest match. **There is no cursor or watermark**, so an
  already-present message returns immediately and duplicate avoidance is the caller's job.
  (Task waits bypass this with a full-mailbox header search, `imap.ts:1003-1012`.)
- Slots are capped at `MAX_WAITS_PER_ADDRESS = 3`, `MAX_WAITS_TOTAL = 8`
  (`ratelimit.ts:205-206`), returning `429 {error:'too_many_waits', retryAfterSec:5}`.
- `Bun.serve` runs with `idleTimeout: 0` (`main.ts:51`) specifically so these long
  connections are not cut at the server layer.
- Returns the full `MessageDetail` (text, html, OTP codes and links) on success, or
  `408 {error:'timeout', timeoutSec}` on expiry.

### 11.2 The inversion — why neither replaces the other

The two mechanisms have **opposite reachability requirements**:

| | `mail_wait_for` | webhook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who initiates | consumer | OAE |
| Who must be reachable from the internet | **OAE only** | **OAE and the consumer** |
| Works for an agent on a laptop / behind NAT / in CI | yes | **no** |
| Works with no long-lived agent process | no | **yes** |
| Latency to notification | up to the poll interval | one round trip |
| Holds a scarce slot while waiting | yes (8 instance-wide) | no |
| Holds an IMAP connection while waiting | yes | no (shared watcher loop) |
| Delivers content in the response | yes, full detail | no, bounded + refetch |

The row that decides the relationship is the second one. **Webhooks require the consumer
to be publicly addressable; long-polling requires only that OAE is.** A large fraction of
real OAE agents — a developer's laptop, a CI job, an agent behind carrier NAT, a
`localhost` MCP client — can never receive a webhook. Deprecating long-polling would
delete those users.

So: **webhooks do not replace `mail_wait_for`. They invert who must be reachable, and the
two cover disjoint deployment shapes.** `mail_wait_for` is unchanged by this RFC and is
not deprecated, not discouraged, and not scheduled for removal.

### 11.3 What webhooks relieve

The genuine win is slot pressure and process shape, and it is worth quantifying:

- `MAX_WAITS_TOTAL = 8` is a hard ceiling on how many agents can be *waiting* on one
  instance at once. A ninth gets `429`. Webhooks lift that ceiling without raising it,
  because a webhook consumer holds no slot at all.
- Each wait also holds an IMAP connection and a mailbox lock for its duration. Eight
  concurrent waits is eight held connections against one Dovecot. The webhook path uses
  the **one** process-wide watcher loop that already exists.
- The dominant agent pattern today is necessarily "loop: wait 60 s, on timeout loop
  again" — a permanently running process burning a slot to discover nothing. With
  webhooks the agent can be a **function invoked per event**, which is precisely #109's
  "wake a headless agent per incoming mail instead of polling or long-lived processes".

**The two slot pools must be separate.** A webhook delivery pool sized 8 that shared
counters with the wait pool would let a burst of outbound deliveries starve
`mail_wait_for`, and vice versa. §8.7 sizes them independently for this reason.

### 11.4 The prerequisite refactor (the real cost of this RFC)

The only place that observes each new message exactly once, with a UID watermark and
reconnect handling, is the notification watcher (§3.1). That watermark is **in-memory** — it
survives a dropped IMAP connection but not a process restart (`notification-watcher.ts:138`,
`:1555`; see §8.6). Webhooks should still emit from there: `processWatchedMessage()` already
parses the message and applies gating, so a webhook dispatch is a sibling of the existing ntfy
publish.

But that loop is gated on ntfy at **two** levels:

```
main.ts:40                     if (config.ntfy.enabled) { … startNotificationWatcher(); }
notification-watcher.ts:1603   if (!config.ntfy.enabled || config.ntfy.pushPolicy === 'none') return () => {};
```

If webhooks are simply added inside that loop, then **an operator who does not run ntfy
gets no webhooks** — and ntfy is off by default (`NTFY_ENABLED` defaults to `'false'`).
Worse, `PUSH_POLICY=none` would disable webhooks too, which is a category error: push
policy governs what goes to a phone, not what goes to the operator's own HTTPS endpoint.

The required change, which should land **before** the webhook feature (§15):

1. Widen the startup gate to
   `(config.ntfy.enabled && config.ntfy.pushPolicy !== 'none') || config.webhooks.enabled`.
   Note this widens the **watcher loop** only: `initializeNotifications()` (`main.ts:41`)
   provisions ntfy's server config and credentials and must stay inside
   `if (config.ntfy.enabled)`. Booting ntfy provisioning because webhooks are on would be
   its own bug.
2. Factor the loop into a neutral **inbound-mail event bus**: the IMAP IDLE connection,
   UID watermark, `UIDVALIDITY` re-anchoring, and reconnect backoff stay where they are;
   the per-message fan-out becomes a list of sinks.

   **The bus's IMAP fetch must be widened, and this is a hard requirement rather than an
   implementation detail.** The watcher today fetches
   `{ envelope: true, headers: ['delivered-to'], source: true }`
   (`notification-watcher.ts:1457-1461`) — which is enough for ntfy's tiers but is missing two
   things the webhook payload needs:

   - **`flags`**, without which `data.unread` (§6.2) cannot be populated at all. There is no
     `\Seen` state in the current fetch.
   - **`internalDate`**, which must be the source of `data.receivedAt`. Using the envelope
     `date` instead would take the arrival time from the sender-supplied `Date:` header, which
     any external sender can set arbitrarily — so a consumer ordering or windowing on
     `receivedAt` (§8.4) would be ordering on attacker-controlled data, and a future spam or
     triage rule built on it would be trivially evaded. `internalDate` is server-assigned and
     is also what `mail-cursor.ts` sorts on, so using it keeps the payload, the cursor, and the
     list API on one clock.

   Widening the fetch touches the ntfy path too, since both sinks share it; that is acceptable
   (it is strictly more data, and ntfy ignores what it does not use) but it must be called out
   in PR 2's review because it changes a hot loop's per-message cost.
3. Make ntfy and webhooks two independent sinks, each with its own enablement, its own
   gating, its own retry policy, and its own failure accounting. **A failure in one sink
   must not affect the other's watermark advancement.** Today a publish failure can retain
   the UID for up to `SERVICE_FAILURE_MAX_MS`; with two sinks that retention decision must
   become per-sink, or a dead webhook endpoint would stall ntfy delivery and vice versa.

Item 3 is the subtle one and the most likely to be gotten wrong in implementation. It is
called out here explicitly so a reviewer can check it.

4. **Give the bus a second producer, because D1 added a non-mail event.** Everything above
   describes refactoring the *inbound-mail* loop, and that was sufficient when v1 emitted only
   `mail.received`. Decision **D1** (§17) added `approval.requested`, which emits from
   `createApprovalTask()` (`tasks-internal.ts:1524`) — a request-handler call path with no
   IMAP IDLE connection, no UID watermark, and no reconnect loop anywhere near it. So the
   abstraction cannot be "the watcher, with sinks"; it has to be a **process-wide dispatcher**
   with two producers feeding it:

   | Producer | Source | Dedupe key | Failure semantics |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | inbound-mail loop | IMAP UID watermark (**in-memory**) | `(uidValidity, uid)` | per-sink watermark retention (item 3) |
   | task path | `createApprovalTask()` return | the task `id` | no watermark at all — see below |

   **Both producers lose events across a restart, and an earlier draft of this section claimed
   otherwise.** It asserted the mail producer "can recover across a restart because the UID
   watermark is durable-ish". It is not durable at all: the watermark lives in process memory
   (`notification-watcher.ts:138`), is recreated empty on every run (`:1555`), and first sight
   of a mailbox generation anchors to the current high-water UID and **emits nothing**
   (`:216-218`). So a restart skips every message that arrived during the gap. The task
   producer behaves the same way for a different reason: creation is a one-shot API call
   rather than a rescannable state, so if the process dies between writing the approval task
   and dispatching the event, nothing re-observes it.

   The real difference is **latent**, not actual. The mailbox is still there after a restart,
   so the mail producer *could* be made recoverable by persisting a watermark and re-walking —
   which is §16 Q5 and needs the forward cursor from §3.7. The task producer has no equivalent
   path short of the approval reaper that `approval.expired` already needs (§2.2). Under the
   weak restart semantics **D7** accepted (§8.6), both events are simply lost today.

   That makes the approval case the more serious of the two, and it is recorded as such rather
   than papered over: a lost `mail.received` means an agent polls a little longer, while a lost
   `approval.requested` means a human is never paged about
   an approval that is silently counting down to a deadline nobody will materialize (§2.2).
   If the owner later decides that is not acceptable, the fix is a task-side sweep analogous
   to the approval reaper that `approval.expired` already needs, and the two should be
   designed together rather than separately.

**Delivery must never block the producer.** Both producers sit on paths that already have
their own latency contracts: the mail loop owns one shared IDLE connection, and
`createApprovalTask()` is inside an HTTP request that returns a `201` with the task view. A
webhook attempt takes up to `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` (10 s) and may be one of eleven.
Dispatch is therefore **hand-off, not await**: the producer enqueues and returns, and the
delivery pool (§8.7) owns the rest. If the queue is full, the event is written to the
delivery log as pending and picked up by the scheduler — never dropped, and never allowed to
turn a task-creation request into a 10-second request.

This refactor touches production code that currently works, for a feature that does not yet
exist, and D1 made it materially larger than the mail-only version this document first
scoped. That is a real risk and the owner should see it as the main cost of #109 — not the
crypto, not the SSRF work. Per decision **D6** (§17) the commander dispatches this PR, with
ownership still to be assigned.

### 11.5 Migration guidance

- **No migration.** Both mechanisms are permanent.
- Recommended combined pattern for a public agent: subscribe a webhook, and keep
  `mail_wait_for` as the fallback path for when the endpoint is unreachable or disabled.
  **The two channels use different identifiers, and this is the trap.** A webhook event `id`
  is an `evt_` UUID; the `id` in a `mail_wait_for` response is the numeric IMAP UID (the same
  value the webhook carries as `data.messageId`, §6.2). So idempotency on `id` — correct for
  deduping repeated *webhook attempts* (§8.1) — cannot recognize the same mail arriving once
  through each channel. The cross-channel dedupe key is **`data.messageId` on the webhook side
  matched against `id` on the wait side**, and the event UUID is scoped to webhook delivery
  only.

  **The limit of that key, stated because it cannot be fixed from the consumer side.** UIDs are
  unique only within a mailbox generation. The webhook payload does carry `data.uidValidity`
  (§6.2), but `mail_wait_for` returns a `MessageDetail` (`imap.ts:58-74`) that has **no
  `uidValidity` field** — so a consumer using both channels cannot build a
  generation-qualified key, and after an INBOX recreation a reused UID could cause it to
  wrongly suppress a genuinely new message. The practical mitigation is to **bound the dedupe
  window** rather than keep it forever: expire entries after something like
  `RETENTION_DAYS`, since a message older than the retention window cannot reappear anyway.
  Adding `uidValidity` to `MessageDetail` would remove the limitation and is a small,
  independent improvement — §16 Q22.

  Documenting this is not optional: the combined pattern is the one §11.5 actively recommends,
  so getting it wrong is the default outcome unless the docs say otherwise.
- Documented anti-pattern: running both a webhook subscription *and* a tight
  `mail_wait_for` loop for the same address. It doubles the load and guarantees duplicates.
  Deduping on `data.messageId` (previous bullet) makes it *correct*, but not sensible — the
  point of the webhook is to stop holding a wait slot.
- Whether `mail_wait_for` should gain cursor support — it currently rescans the newest 20
  with no watermark, so it is duplicate-prone in a way webhooks are not — is a real
  asymmetry, and §16, Q8. It is out of scope here.

## 12. Security model

### 12.1 Signing key: derive, do not store

Two candidate designs:

**(A) Random per-endpoint secret, persisted.** Generate `whs_<random>` at creation, store
it, show it once. This is what GitHub and Stripe do.

**(B) Derive the per-endpoint key from a root secret.**
`endpointKey = HMAC-SHA256(rootSecret, "webhook-signing-v1\n" + webhookId + "\n" + epoch)`,
following the exact precedent of `notifyCursorSecret` (`config.ts:309`), whose comment
records the rule (translated): domain-separate from the root, **add no new env var**.

**The textual encoding is normative, because getting it wrong is silent and total.**
`endpointKey` above is 32 raw bytes, but a secret has to be *shown to an operator* and
*typed into a consumer's config*, so it needs a string form. The rule:

```
displayedSecret = "whs_" + lowerCaseHex(endpointKey)     // "whs_" + 64 hex chars = 68 chars
signingKey      = utf8Bytes(displayedSecret)             // 68 bytes — the ASCII string itself
```

The HMAC key used to sign deliveries is **the 68 ASCII bytes of the displayed string,
including the `whs_` prefix** — not the 32 raw digest bytes. This is stated explicitly
because the two choices produce different signatures and a producer/consumer mismatch fails
*every* delivery with no diagnostic: the consumer's verification simply never matches.
Making the displayed string *be* the key means what an operator copies out of the `201`
response is exactly what they paste into their verifier, with no encoding step in between
to get wrong — which is also what makes the `openssl dgst -hmac "$ENDPOINT_SECRET"` example
in §7.3 correct as written. The `whs_` prefix is part of the key material, and it doubles as
a grep-able marker for `redactSecrets()` (§12.3).

The trailing `epoch` is not decoration — it is what makes per-endpoint rotation possible.
Without it the key is a pure function of `webhookId`, so `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/rotate`
(§10.3) could only produce a new key by rotating the **root**, which would invalidate every
other endpoint on the instance and contradict §12.2. `epoch` is a small integer persisted
per subscription in `webhooks.json` (§10.5) and incremented on each rotation, so the
derivation stays deterministic and re-displayable while each rotation yields a fresh,
endpoint-scoped key. The `\n`-joined construction follows `taskStamp` (`tasks-internal.ts:458`)
and avoids the field-boundary ambiguity that `mail-body-v2` length-prefixing exists to
prevent, because both `webhookId` and `epoch` have fixed, separator-free formats.

**Recommendation: (B), with `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` as an optional explicit root.**

Reasons, in order of weight:

1. **(A) would be the first usable secret ever persisted by this codebase.** Every
   existing bearer secret is stored as a SHA-256 hash used only for comparison
   (`identities.ts:279`, `oauth-store.ts:271`), and `notification-devices.ts:112`
   hard-refuses to persist anything under a `password` or `token` key. A webhook signing
   secret is different in kind: it must be *used* to compute an HMAC, so it cannot be
   stored hashed. Adopting (A) means introducing plaintext-secret-at-rest, a new
   threat class for the repo, in a 0600 JSON file next to the identity registry. (B)
   stores nothing secret.
2. **(B) is re-derivable, so the reveal-once constraint softens.** With (A), a lost
   secret forces a rotation and a consumer-side cutover. With (B) an admin can re-display
   the current key at any time, because the server can always recompute it. That is a
   meaningfully better operator experience for a self-hosted product administered over SSH.
3. **(B) gets per-endpoint key isolation anyway.** Distinct `webhookId` inputs give
   distinct keys, so compromising one endpoint's key reveals nothing about another's, and
   deleting an endpoint *is* revoking its key.
4. **HMAC is a PRF, so publishing a derived key does not expose the root.** This matters
   because the derived key is handed to a third party.

**Cost of (B), stated plainly:** rotating the root secret invalidates every endpoint's key
at once. Mitigations: the multi-signature overlap window (§12.2) applies to root rotation
too, and an operator who needs independent rotation sets `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
separately from `TASK_SIGNING_SECRET`.

**The `SMTP_PASS` fallback must be refused.** `config.ts:281` lets `taskSigningSecret`
fall back to `SMTP_PASS`. That fallback is already refused for the one existing feature
that sends signed material to an external party — `ALWAYS_BCC` requires an explicit
`TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` ≥ 32 chars (`config.ts:270-280`) — and `mail-stamp.ts:141` refuses
to stamp at all when any recipient is off-domain, explicitly to avoid an HMAC oracle over
`SMTP_PASS`.

Webhooks are a strictly stronger case for that rule: the derived key is *handed to a
third party*. A derived key does not reveal the root, but the root would then be the SMTP
password, and coupling mail-transport credentials to a key distributed to arbitrary
external endpoints is unacceptable. Hence boot-time rule §10.2 item 1. This is not a new
policy — it is the existing policy applied to a new egress path.

### 12.2 Rotation with overlap

Multi-signature headers, as documented by both Svix/Standard Webhooks and Stripe (§4.2,
§4.3). GitHub publishes no rotation procedure at all; its dual emission of `X-Hub-Signature`
(SHA-1) and `X-Hub-Signature-256` is migration between *algorithms*, not between *secrets*,
and is the weaker cousin of what is adopted here.

1. `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/rotate` **increments that subscription's persisted `epoch`**
   (§10.5), which changes the derived key for this endpoint and no other (§12.1). It does
   **not** rotate the root secret — that would invalidate every endpoint on the instance —
   and it is not the same operation as setting `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, which is an
   instance configuration change made by restarting with a different environment, not an
   endpoint rotation. The first draft of this step conflated all three; review caught it.
2. For `WEBHOOK_ROTATION_OVERLAP_MS` (default 24 h), every delivery carries **both**
   signatures: `X-OAE-Signature: t=…,v1=<new>,v1=<old>`. Both are computed from the same
   root, at `epoch` and `epoch - 1`, so the overlap needs no secret storage — only the
   knowledge that a rotation is in progress and when it ends (§10.5).
3. The consumer migrates to the new key at its own pace within the window. Verification
   tries every `v1=` value (§7.3 step 2), so no consumer-side coordination is needed to
   survive the window.
4. After the window, only the new signature is sent. `epoch - 1` is no longer used to sign.
5. `WEBHOOK_ROTATION_OVERLAP_MS=0` gives an atomic swap for operators who prefer it.

**The overlap covers epoch rotation, and does *not* automatically cover a root-secret
change.** This distinction is easy to get wrong and the first draft got it wrong. Steps 1–5
work because both keys derive from the **same** root at two epochs, so the process can compute
both. Changing `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (or the `TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` it falls back to) is
different: after a restart the process holds only the *new* root, and deriving `epoch - 1`
from it yields a key that was never used by anyone — the actual previous key is unrecoverable.
Every endpoint would switch keys atomically and reject deliveries until each consumer is
reconfigured, with no overlap at all.

So root rotation is specified honestly as one of two operator choices:

- **Coordinated cutover (default).** Change the root, restart, and reconfigure consumers.
  Accept a window of failed verification. Appropriate when the root is being rotated *because*
  it leaked, since continuing to sign with the old root is then worse than dropping events.
- **Overlapped root rotation (opt-in).** Set `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET_PREVIOUS` to the old root
  for the duration of `WEBHOOK_ROTATION_OVERLAP_MS`. The signer emits `v1=` under both the new
  and previous roots, giving the same zero-downtime property as epoch rotation. The variable
  is optional, read only at boot, never persisted, and cleared by the operator once the window
  closes.

This is the one place where the derived-key design (D6) is *weaker* than a stored random
secret, which would survive a root change unaffected. It is recorded as a real cost of D6
rather than glossed, and it is the reason `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` exists as an explicit
override in the first place: an operator who expects to rotate the task root often can give
webhooks their own.

**Idempotency needs a mechanism, not an instruction.** The response body of `rotate`
includes `overlapUntil` and the new `epoch` so the operator knows the deadline. But a client
that times out after a *successful* rotation and retries the POST cannot be distinguished
from an operator intentionally rotating twice, and "the operation must be idempotent" does
not by itself prevent a second epoch increment and a second, different secret being returned
— which would leave the consumer holding a key OAE no longer signs with. So the contract is
concrete:

> `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/rotate` accepts an optional `Idempotency-Key` header (opaque
> string, ≤ 200 chars). The key, the resulting `epoch`, and the response body are persisted
> for `WEBHOOK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`. A retry presenting a key already seen returns the
> **stored** response with `200` and does not increment the epoch. A request with no key is
> treated as an intentional rotation and always increments.

**Rotating again while an overlap window is open.** The signer emits `v1=` under `epoch` and
`epoch - 1` only (§12.2 step 2), so a second rotation inside the first's 24-hour window would
advance to `epoch + 1` and sign with `(epoch+1, epoch)` — **immediately dropping `epoch - 1`**,
the key a consumer from the first rotation may still be migrating off. The overlap guarantee
would silently stop being one. The behavior is therefore explicit:

- **Default: reject with `409 {error:'rotation_window_open'}`,** including `overlapUntil` in
  the response so the caller knows when to retry. Rotation is rare and deliberate; silently
  breaking an in-flight migration to satisfy a second request is the wrong default.
- **Explicit override: `{"force": true}`** in the request body truncates the open window and
  proceeds. This is the correct choice when rotating *because a key leaked* — continuing to
  honor the compromised generation is then worse than cutting off a slow consumer. The
  truncation is recorded in the audit event so the operator can see why deliveries started
  failing.
- Retaining three generations instead was considered and rejected: it makes the verification
  contract ("try every `v1=`") unbounded in a way consumers cannot predict, and the only
  scenario needing it is two overlapping *planned* rotations, which the 409 already
  discourages.

This mirrors how the repo already treats caller-supplied dedupe identifiers
(`X-OA-Task-Idempotency-Key`, `tasks-internal.ts:923`) rather than inventing a new convention.
Rotation writes an audit event in all cases, including the 409.

### 12.3 Secret handling

- Shown in the `201` create response and the `rotate` response. Because D6 chose derived
  keys (§12.1), the key is **re-derivable**, so a re-display route is specified rather than
  left as an open question: `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/secret`, audited as `webhook.reveal`.

  **Authorization for re-display follows Rule B, and admin-only would have been a hole.** The
  first draft made this route admin-only. Combined with the idempotent-replay rule in §12.2 —
  a replayed `rotate` returns `secret: null` rather than persisting plaintext — that left an
  **identity** caller who lost the original `rotate` response with no way ever to recover the
  key for a subscription it legitimately owns: it could not re-display (admin-only) and could
  not re-rotate idempotently (returns null), so its only option was a non-idempotent rotation
  that invalidates whatever the consumer had. So:

  | Caller | May re-display |
  | --- | --- |
  | admin | any subscription |
  | identity token | subscriptions **it created** (`createdBy` = its own address) **and** whose `contentScope` is `metadata` |
  | identity token | **not** subscriptions an admin created for its address, at any scope |
  | oauth token | none (Rule A excludes it from secret-bearing operations) |

  **The `createdBy` condition is the important one, and its absence was a hole this document
  introduced.** R48 fixed a recovery gap by letting identity tokens re-display their own
  subscriptions, but scoped that by *address* and *content scope* only. An admin routinely
  creates a `metadata` subscription **for** an agent's address — that is the ordinary
  postmaster-wake-up setup — and under the address-only rule the agent's own identity token
  could then re-display that subscription's live signing key. It can already read the
  subscription's `url` from `GET /v1/webhooks/:id` (§10.3). Key plus URL is enough to **forge
  deliveries the consumer will verify as authentic**: `metadata` scope limits what OAE will
  *disclose*, but it does nothing to protect the *integrity* of what the consumer receives.
  Confidentiality scoping was the wrong axis; ownership is the right one.

  So the rule is creator-scoped: an identity token may re-display only what it created. An
  admin-created subscription is admin-only to re-display, which is also symmetric with Rule B
  — the party that chose the endpoint and the scope is the party that holds its key material.
  The recovery concern R48 raised is still fully served, because the caller who loses a
  `rotate` response is the same caller that performed the rotation, and Rule B already
  restricts rotation on admin-created `preview` subscriptions to admin.
- Never returned by any `GET` **except** `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/secret`, which is audited and
  restricted per the table above. Every list and detail response carries `secretPrefix` alone.
- Never written to `webhooks.json`, the delivery log, the audit log, or application
  output. Enforced structurally by a `FORBIDDEN_SECRET_KEYS` guard, following
  `notification-devices.ts:112`.
- `redactSecrets()` (`lib/redact.ts`) is the existing log-redaction path; the `whs_`
  prefix should be added to its patterns so an accidentally logged secret is still
  scrubbed. Defense in depth, not the primary control.
- The `secretPrefix` stored for display is the first 8 characters — enough to
  disambiguate, too short to narrow a search.

### 12.4 Threat model

| Threat | Mitigation | §|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forged delivery to a consumer | HMAC-SHA256, mandatory, fail closed | 7 |
| Replay of a captured delivery | 300 s timestamp tolerance + consumer dedupe on `id` | 7.4 |
| SSRF to cloud metadata / internal services | shared `net.ts` policy, always-block ranges | 9.2 |
| DNS rebinding between validation and connect | re-validate every attempt + connect-time address pinning | 9.3 |
| Redirect-based SSRF bypass | never follow redirects; 3xx is permanent failure | 9.4 |
| OAE used as a DDoS reflector or port scanner | response cap, concurrency caps, circuit breaker, registration rate limit, no retry on `refused` | 9.7, 8.5 |
| Mail content exfiltrated via a stolen identity token | `metadata`-only for identity tokens; `preview` requires admin; full bodies never included | 6.4 |
| Webhook secret becomes a mail-content credential | It cannot: full content requires an API token via refetch | 4.2, 6.4 |
| Plaintext secret at rest | Derived keys; nothing secret persisted | 12.1 |
| Root secret is the SMTP password | Boot-time refusal of the `SMTP_PASS` fallback when webhooks are enabled | 12.1, 10.2 |
| Secret leaked into logs | field-whitelisted audit, no payload in delivery log, `FORBIDDEN_SECRET_KEYS`, `redactSecrets` | 10.6, 8.6, 12.3 |
| Dead endpoint accumulates unbounded backlog | circuit breaker + immediate dead-letter while disabled | 8.5 |
| Slow/tarpit consumer exhausts the process | per-endpoint concurrency 1, delivery timeout, instance cap | 8.7 |
| Subscription churn abuse | creation rate limit + subscription caps | 8.7 |
| Identity token forging deliveries a consumer will accept | Rule D: re-display, rotate, and delete are **creator-scoped**, so an identity cannot obtain the key of a subscription an admin created for its address (§10.4) | 10.4, 12.3 |
| Refetch returning an unrelated message after an INBOX rebuild | `uidValidity` precondition on `GET /v1/messages/:id`, returning `404 stale_message_generation` rather than a different message; mandatory for event-driven refetch (§6.2) | 6.2, 15 |
| Approval `arguments` carrying arbitrary caller JSON to an external endpoint | `actionArguments` is `preview`-scope only, therefore admin-only, and bounded to 4 KiB at depth 4 against the 64 KiB / depth 10 the task API itself allows | 6.3, 6.6 |
| Approval event delivered to the wrong mailbox | Matching is on `reviewer`, which in v1 is always the task's `to`; `createApprovalTask()` already requires both parties to be managed identities and distinct (`tasks-internal.ts:1528-1529`), so an off-instance reviewer cannot exist | 6.3 |
| Webhooks silently disabled because ntfy is off | gate widening + sink separation (prerequisite refactor) | 11.4 |
| Delivery log becomes a privacy leak when shipped to an aggregator | no payload content and no URL query in any row; `sensitive` is a **marker** for external filtering, not a reducer (§8.6) | 8.6 |

### 12.5 What is explicitly *not* defended

Recorded so nobody discovers it later as a surprise:

- **Replay within the tolerance window** to the same endpoint (§7.4).
- **A malicious consumer endpoint** that logs the payload: once you subscribe an external
  URL, that URL's operator sees the metadata. This is inherent and is why `preview` is
  admin-only.
- **Availability.** Webhooks are best-effort. An agent that must not miss mail uses the
  cursor + list API to catch up (§8.4). This RFC does not make webhooks a reliable queue.
- **Use of OAE's egress IP to probe *public* hosts.** The SSRF policy (§9) keeps internal
  addresses out of reach, and creation-time validation is DNS-only, so there is no
  connect-result oracle at registration. But `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test` still lets a
  stolen identity token make OAE originate connections to public hosts and observe
  distinguishable outcomes and timings. The first draft accepted this with the mitigation
  named but unspecified; **it is now specified** — `WEBHOOK_RATE_TEST_PER_MIN = 3` triggers,
  per token, in a bucket separate from delivery and shared with creation-triggered pings
  (§8.7). Because each accepted ping runs up to three attempts, the real ceiling is
  **~9 connection attempts a minute per token**, not 3, and that is the number to reason
  about. It remains a poor scanning primitive — under 13 000 a day, public hosts only, with
  the SSRF policy keeping internal addresses out of reach. What is accepted is those nine:
  OAE cannot distinguish an operator legitimately testing an endpoint from a token holder
  probing one.
- **A lost `approval.requested` leaves a human unpaged about a deadline nobody will
  materialize.** The task producer has no watermark, so a crash between writing the approval
  task and dispatching the event loses it (§11.4 item 4) — and because expiry is only
  observed when something reads the task (§2.2), nothing later notices the approval sat
  unanswered. Accepted for v1 under the weak restart semantics D7 approved; the reaper that
  `approval.expired` needs is also the fix for this, which is why §17 says the two should be
  designed together.
- **Compromise of the OAE host.** If the host is compromised, the root secret and all
  derived keys are exposed. Same as every other secret in the repo.

## 13. Observability and failure visibility

#109: *"Outbound failures fail visible (health signal), never silent."* Concretely:

1. **Per-endpoint state** on `GET /v1/webhooks/:id`: `state` (`unverified` / `enabled` /
   `disabled`), `disabledReason`, `consecutiveFailures`, and
   `lastDelivery: {at, outcome, status, durationMs, attempt}`.
2. **Instance health.** Extend the admin surface — not the unauthenticated
   `GET /healthz` (`app.ts:56`), which must stay trivial — with a count of disabled
   endpoints and of dead letters in the retention window. A deployment where every
   endpoint is disabled is a deployment that has silently stopped pushing, and that must
   be visible without reading a JSONL file by hand. Since **D4** (§17) this has a home:
   `GET /ui/api/webhooks/summary` and the Configure panel (§10.8) are the operator-facing
   surface, and they read **the same single data source** as the health counts so a panel
   and an alert can never disagree — the rule ADR-0026 applies to its notification summary.
3. **Operator notification on disablement**, via the existing ntfy urgent path where
   `NTFY_ENABLED` is true. Best-effort; must not throw or block.
4. **Structured log lines** for `refused` and `disabled` outcomes at WARN/ERROR, using
   `redactSecrets()`.
5. **Audit events** for every management mutation and every SSRF refusal (§10.6).
6. **The delivery log itself** as the inspection API (§8.6, §10.3), so "why didn't my
   endpoint get this?" is answerable without server access. This mirrors the existing
   "why didn't I receive this notification?" affordance in the dashboard.

---

## 14. Verification strategy

No implementation is proposed, so this records how the design would be proven, in the
repository's existing style — the test suite is the specification's enforcement mechanism,
and `docs/approval-digest.md` sets the precedent of committing **interop vectors** rather
than only unit tests.

1. **Committed signature vectors.** A `webhook-signature-vectors.v1.json` fixture with
   `(key, t, body, expectedSignature)` tuples, verified by a JavaScript test *and* by an
   independent Python standard-library verifier — exactly the dual-verification pattern
   already used for `approval-canonical-vectors.v1.json`. This is what makes the wire
   format safe for third-party implementers, and it is the highest-value test in the
   feature.
2. **SSRF matrix.** A test per blocked range in §9.2 and per rule in §9.5, including
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 and the IPv6 embedded-IPv4 forms that **D16 adds to the shared policy**
   (NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96`, 6to4 `2002::/16`, Teredo — §9.2), decimal/octal/hex IPv4
   encodings, a DNS name resolving to a blocked address, a name whose resolution *changes*
   between validation and connect (rebinding), and a redirect response. Plus the
   highest-value test in the feature: assert the §9.1 `publicEdge` composition — that
   `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=false` blocks a private target even when
   `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE` is unset, and that `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true` blocks it even when the
   webhook escape hatch is on. And the **Rule C rebind case** (§10.4): an identity-created
   subscription whose host resolved publicly at creation, then resolves privately at delivery,
   must be `refused` even though the global escape hatch is on — because it carries no
   `privateTargetGranted`. Because D16 tightens `lib/net.ts` itself, these tests must
   also assert the **existing CIMD consumer still behaves correctly** — the change is shared.
3. **Retry/outcome classification.** A local test server returning each status in §8.2,
   asserting the retry decision and every one of the eleven offsets in §8.3, with a fake
   clock so a 72-hour budget is testable in milliseconds. Include the **D2a** assertions:
   that each `retryable` and `permanent` failure increments `consecutiveFailures` by one, that
   a single success resets it to zero, that `deferred` leaves it unchanged, that `refused`
   disables without reaching the threshold, and that the counter survives a restart.
4. **Gate independence.** Assert that webhooks fire with `NTFY_ENABLED=false`, that ntfy
   publishes with `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=false`, and — the subtle case from §11.4 item 3 —
   that a failing webhook sink does not stall the ntfy sink's watermark, or vice versa.
5. **Storage conventions.** 0600/0700 modes, atomic rename, corrupt-file fail-closed,
   `FORBIDDEN_SECRET_KEYS` refusal, retention compaction.
6. **Payload bounding.** Every field's cap, the ordered overflow behavior (§6.6),
   UTF-8-safety of truncation on multi-byte boundaries, and a hard assertion that no
   payload at any scope exceeds `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES`.
7. **Authorization matrix.** Each route × {admin, own-address identity, other-address
   identity, oauth}, asserting `content_scope_requires_admin` and the address-scoping 403.
   Plus the MCP tier assertions from §10.7: every new tool appears in `TOOL_TIER_SPEC`,
   `mail_webhook_create` is deny-by-default for an OAuth-derived token, **and so is
   `mail_webhook_test`** — its `contained` tier does not make it OAuth-safe on its own, and
   §10.4 Rule A applies to the tool as well as the route, since they perform the identical
   action. An earlier draft asserted the opposite for `test`, which would have left an OAuth
   bypass through the MCP door. **Plus Rule D's creator-scoping**: an identity token must be
   refused re-display, `rotate`, and `delete` on a subscription an *admin* created for its
   address, at `metadata` scope as well as `preview` — the R62 case, which an address-scoped
   test would pass while the hole stayed open.
8. **Rotation and creation idempotency.** That rotation increments the derivation `epoch` so
   the new key differs without touching any other endpoint's key (§12.1); that a repeated
   `rotate` with the same `Idempotency-Key` returns the stored `epoch` without incrementing
   and returns `secret: null`; that a **second rotation inside an open window** returns
   `409 rotation_window_open` unless `force` is set, and that `force` truncates the window and
   audits it (R49); that `POST /v1/webhooks` with a seen `Idempotency-Key` returns the stored
   id without creating a second subscription (R60); and the re-display matrix from §12.3 —
   admin any, identity its own `metadata` only, never `preview`, never OAuth (R48).
9. **`approval.requested` emission (D1).** That creating an approval task emits exactly one
   event; that it is matched to subscriptions on `reviewer`, which in v1 is **always** the
   task's `to` (§6.3) — so a test asserting "matches reviewer but not `to`" would be asserting
   an impossible state and must not be written; that `reviewer`, `to`, and `from` are all
   managed identities and `from !== to`, as `createApprovalTask()` already enforces
   (`tasks-internal.ts:1528-1529`); that `expiresInSec` never exceeds 2592000 and is never
   negative (§6.3); and the property that makes this event stronger than the mail one — that
   recomputing `approvalActionDigest()` over the action fetched from `GET /v1/tasks/:id` equals
   the announced `digest`.
10. **Non-blocking hand-off from both producers (§11.4 item 4).** That `createApprovalTask()`
    still returns its `201` in bounded time when the webhook endpoint is a tarpit, and that
    the mail loop's IDLE connection is not held across a delivery attempt. Assert with a
    consumer that accepts TCP and never responds, which is the worst case for both producers.
11. **Endpoint state machine (§8.5).** `unverified` → `enabled` on first success;
    `enabled` → `disabled` at the threshold; `disabled` → `unverified` on manual enable;
    that events **are** delivered while `unverified`; that events are **not** delivered while
    `disabled`; and that `refused` disables immediately without reaching the threshold.
12. **Read-only dashboard panel (D4).** That every `/ui/api/webhooks*` route is a GET, that
    no mutating webhook route exists under `/ui/api`, that all of them 404 when
    `UI_ENABLED=false`, that an identity session sees only its own address, that deliveries
    are admin-only, and that no response contains a `secret` field — only `secretPrefix`.
13. **Unconditional boot rule (R1).** That `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=true` with no explicit
    `TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` fails the boot **even when `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is set**, and
    that no webhook payload can be produced while `taskSigningSecret` equals `SMTP_PASS`.
    This is the highest-value configuration test in the feature, because the failure mode is
    a leaked MAC oracle rather than a crash.
14. **OAuth refusal on the REST path (R2).** That `POST /v1/webhooks` with an OAuth access
    token returns the 403 even though `getAuth(c)` reports `kind: 'identity'` — i.e. assert
    the route consults attribution, not `Auth`. A test that only exercises the MCP tool would
    pass while the hole stayed open, which is exactly how the first draft shipped it.
15. **Boot reconstruction (R3, R4, R9).** With a log containing two failed attempts for one
    `(webhookId, eventId)` pair, assert exactly **one** retry is enqueued; with a
    `nextAttemptAt` in the past, assert it runs rather than being dropped; with a
    success for the same event under a *different* `webhookId`, assert the first endpoint's
    retry still runs; and with a changed `UIDVALIDITY`, assert a `uidvalidity_changed`
    dead letter rather than a fetch by stale UID.
16. **Rotation idempotency (R7).** That a repeated `POST …/rotate` with the same
    `Idempotency-Key` returns the stored `epoch` without incrementing, that a request with no
    key always increments, and that a replayed response never contains the plaintext secret
    (§10.5).
17. **Generation-preconditioned refetch (R63).** That `GET /v1/messages/:id` with a
    `uidValidity` that does not match the current mailbox generation returns
    `404 stale_message_generation` and **not** a different message; that omitting the parameter
    preserves today's behavior for existing callers; and that the webhook docs' refetch example
    includes the parameter. This is the test that keeps §6.2's `uidValidity` field from being
    decorative.
18. **`/test` against a disabled endpoint (R64).** That it returns `409 webhook_disabled` with
    the reason, fires no ping, writes no delivery row, and does not change `state` — for each of
    the three `disabledReason` values.
19. **The two deferral paths (R69).** That a rate-limit denial reschedules at
    `max(retryAfterSec, next offset)` and a pool-saturation denial at
    `now + WEBHOOK_POOL_RETRY_MS`; that neither consumes an attempt, increments
    `consecutiveFailures`, nor dead-letters; and that `WEBHOOK_POOL_RETRY_MS` cannot be
    configured below its 1000 ms floor.
20. **Audit / delivery-log separation (R70).** That a run of N deliveries writes N rows to
    `webhook-deliveries.jsonl` and **zero** `webhook.deliver` rows to `audit.jsonl`, while
    create / rotate / reveal / disable / enable / `ssrf_refused` each write exactly one audit
    row. The point of the test is the volume property, so it should assert the audit file's
    size is unchanged across a large delivery run.

## 15. Phasing

If ratified, this is six PRs, and the ordering matters because PR 1 and PR 2 touch
working production code and should be independently revertible:

| PR | Content | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Generalize `pinnedCimdFetcher` into a shared pinned fetcher parameterized by timeout and byte cap, **add an absolute wall-clock deadline** alongside its inactivity-based `req.setTimeout()` (§9.7), promote the document-fetch wrapper's redirect refusal into that shared policy (§9.1), **and close the IPv6 embedded-IPv4 gap** — NAT64, 6to4, Teredo (§9.2) — per decision **D16** (§17). **Ships with the §14 item 2 SSRF matrix**, including the rebinding, redirect, IPv6-form and slowloris cases and the CIMD regression guard | low–medium — refactor plus two tightenings; the tests land in the same PR, so the change cannot merge unguarded |
| 2 | Factor the notification watcher into a **process-wide event dispatcher with two producers** — the inbound-mail loop *and* the task-creation path (§11.4 item 4) — with per-sink enablement, gating, retry, and **per-sink** watermark advancement; widen the startup gate; ntfy remains the only sink | **high** — touches a working loop *and* the task creation path; enlarged by D1. Dispatched by the commander, ownership TBD (**D6**) |
| 3 | Add a **forward** `since` query to `GET /v1/messages` (new IMAP selection, plus a signed forward cursor reusing `mail-cursor-v1`'s construction and address binding, itself bound to `uidValidity`), **and** add the `uidValidity` precondition to `GET /v1/messages/:id` so a stale generation returns `404 stale_message_generation` instead of an unrelated message (§6.2). The existing cursor paginates *backwards* and the detail route has no generation check at all (`imap.ts` never mentions `uidValidity`) | **medium** — new IMAP query semantics plus a contract change on an existing route |
| 4 | Webhook subsystem: config, `webhooks.json`, signing, delivery for **both** `mail.received` and `approval.requested`, retry, circuit breaker, delivery log, REST routes, the five MCP tools with their `TOOL_TIER_SPEC` entries (§10.7), audit. **Ships with the §14 item 1 signature interop vectors** (JS + independent Python verifiers) and items 3, 5–16 | additive — behind `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=false` |
| 5 | Read-only dashboard panel under Configure (§10.8), per decision **D4**. Ships with §14 item 12 | additive — GET-only `/ui/api` mirrors plus `UI_CSS` edits; no write surface |
| 6 | Docs and packaging only: `.env.example` and `compose.yaml` entries, the consumer-facing verification guide, and the website-repo docs handoff | additive — no code |

**Every security test ships in the PR that makes the change it protects.** An earlier phasing
put the SSRF matrix and the signature vectors in a final "tests and docs" PR, which would have
merged a modification to the shared SSRF policy (PR 1) and the entire signing scheme (PR 4)
with their guards still unwritten — and a guard added later can only reject a change that has
already landed. Tests are not a phase. PR 6 is left with documentation and packaging, which is
the only content that genuinely has no code to guard.

PR 2 is now the riskiest item in the plan and is rated **high** rather than medium, because
D1 turned it from "refactor the watcher" into "build a dispatcher that also sits inside the
task-creation request path". §11.4 item 4 explains why the two producers have genuinely
different recovery semantics, and §14 item 4 is the guard. It should not be started until its
owner is named (**D6**).

PR 3 is load-bearing and, after review, larger than it first looked. The original plan was to
expose the existing cursor on the bearer API, but §3.7 records that this cursor paginates
*backwards* — it cannot express "everything since my last delivery". So PR 3 builds a forward
query rather than surfacing an existing one. Without it the `cursor` in a webhook payload is a
position marker a consumer can record but cannot spend, and the "push to wake, pull to read"
pattern in §8.4 has no pull half. It is still sequenced before the webhook subsystem so the
payload field is useful the day it ships.

PR 4 lands dark: `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` defaults to `'false'`, so merging it changes nothing
for any running deployment. That is the same rollout posture as `TASK_LEASES_ENABLED` and
`NTFY_ENABLED`. PR 5 depends on PR 4's routes and is separately revertible.

These are the decisions this RFC could not make alone. Each has a recommendation where one
is defensible.

**Q1 — v1 event catalog.** `mail.received` only, or pull `approval.requested` forward?
#109 frames the human-in-the-loop approval case (push to ntfy/Telegram the instant an
approval is needed) as one of the top unlocks, and it may be worth more than the postmaster
case. *Cost of including it:* a second emission site in the task path, and
`approval.expired` has no emitter at all today (expiry is evaluated lazily on read), so a
complete approval trio needs a reaper. *Recommendation:* ship `mail.received` alone to
prove the delivery machinery, then add `approval.requested` as the immediate follow-up —
but decide now, because it determines whether PR 2's event bus must span the task path.

**Q2 — `contentScope: preview` gating.** Admin-only (recommended, §6.5), or available to
an identity token with an explicit acknowledgement flag mirroring push tier 3's
`confirm_risk=true`? *Trade-off:* an autonomous agent that cannot escalate its own scope
needs a human to enable the useful case; allowing self-escalation with a flag turns a
stolen identity token into a content-exfiltration channel.

**Q3 — Signing key: derived (B) or stored random (A)?** §12.1 recommends (B). *Decide
explicitly*, because (A) introduces the repository's first plaintext usable secret at rest
and should not happen by accident. Sub-question under (B): expose an admin-only
re-display of the current derived key, or keep reveal-once discipline?

**Q4 — Retry budget.** 8 attempts / ~27 h 35 min, adopting Resend's published schedule
(recommended, §8.3); Stripe's and SendGrid's ~3 days; the watcher's existing 10 minutes; or
GitHub's model of no automatic retry at all? This is really a question about **how
perishable a mail event is**, and the owner knows the answer better than the design does.
The recommended schedule is front-loaded — four attempts inside 35 minutes — so the
perishable cases are already served early and the long tail only buys availability.
`WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` truncates the table, so shortening this later is a config change
rather than a redesign.

**Q5 — Restart recovery.** Is "pending retries reconstructed from the delivery log, events
emitted while down are lost" (§8.6) acceptable for v1, or must OAE re-walk the mailbox
from the last delivered cursor on boot and re-emit? The cursor in the payload (§3.7) makes
the stronger version feasible. *Recommendation:* accept the weaker version for v1, because
the stronger one needs a per-subscription durable "last delivered cursor" and a bounded
re-walk, which is real work; but this is the question most likely to bite an operator
during a routine container restart.

**Q6 — Ownership of the prerequisite refactor (§11.4).** The event-bus extraction touches
working production code for a feature that does not exist yet, and item 3 (per-sink
watermark advancement) is subtle. Who owns PR 2, and is it acceptable for it to land with
no user-visible change?

**Q7 — Multi-tenant hosted policy.** If OAE is ever hosted for multiple tenants, is
webhook egress allowed at all? Per-endpoint rate limits, subscription caps, and abuse
surface all change shape on shared infrastructure, and `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true` becomes the
norm rather than the exception. #109 lists this as an open question; this RFC deliberately
does not answer it.

**Q8 — Should `mail_wait_for` gain cursor support?** It currently rescans the newest 20
messages with no watermark (§11.1), so it is duplicate-prone in a way webhooks are not.
Now that a signed cursor exists and is embedded in webhook payloads, adding cursor support
to long-polling would make the two mechanisms fully symmetric. Out of scope here; worth a
card.

**Q9 — Inbound webhooks.** External system POSTs in → becomes mail or a task. Same design
or a split card? #109 says "separate card if pursued". *Recommendation:* split — the trust
direction is opposite and the auth model is unrelated.

**Q10 — Dashboard surface.** Read-only deliveries/dead-letters view under Configure in v1,
or REST-only with the UI deferred? ADR-0026 already plans a Configure section and a
notification-log view; a webhook panel would fit there naturally, but §2.2 excludes new UI.

**Q11 — Circuit-breaker recovery.** Manual re-enable only (recommended, §8.5), or an
automatic periodic probe that re-enables on success? Auto-recovery risks silently resuming
after a window of dropped events; manual-only risks an operator not noticing.

**Q12 — `webhook.ping` at creation: synchronous or asynchronous?** GitHub fires a `ping` on
creation but does not document whether it is synchronous with the creation call (§4.1), so
there is no vendor answer to copy. Validating *during* `POST /v1/webhooks` gives far better
operator feedback
("your endpoint is unreachable" at creation, not 30 seconds later in a log) but couples
create latency to a third party and needs its own timeout. *Recommendation:* create
asynchronously, and make `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/test` the synchronous-feeling path. If the
owner wants create-time verification feedback, the cleanest form is a third endpoint state
— `unverified` until the first ping succeeds, alongside `enabled` and `disabled` (§8.5,
§10.3) — which is a real addition to the state machine and should be decided as such rather
than implied by a response field.

**Q13 — Signature encoding: hex or base64url?** §7.2 recommends hex and explicitly deviates
from this repo's base64url stamp convention (`taskStamp`, `mail-stamp`, `mail-cursor`).
The vendors split: GitHub (`sha256=<hex>`) and Stripe (`v1=<hex>`) use hex, while
Svix/Standard Webhooks uses `v1,<base64>`. Hex is what the majority of existing consumer
snippets and libraries assume, which is the whole argument; base64url would be internally
consistent and 25% shorter. This is a one-way door — once an integrator ships a verifier,
the encoding cannot change without a `v2=`. Related and smaller: should event ids move to a
sortable scheme (UUIDv7/ULID) instead of UUIDv4? Sorting is not needed given `data.cursor`,
but sortable ids make log correlation easier for consumers.

**Q14 — Should `WEBHOOK_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS` be per-instance only, or also per-identity?**
§8.7 caps per address at 4. On a many-identity instance, 4 × N identities could still be a
large number of egress targets. Whether that needs a global cap below the instance maximum
depends on the hosted answer to Q7.

**Q15 — Should redelivery cover *succeeded* deliveries, or only dead letters?** Resend
documents replaying both (§4.3), and replaying a success is how an integrator tests their
handler against a real payload without waiting for real mail. §10.3 currently scopes
`redeliver` to dead letters. Extending it to successes is cheap (the log records both) but
means OAE will re-send an event a consumer already processed, so it leans harder on the
consumer's `id` dedupe. *Recommendation:* allow it, admin-only, and mark the resulting
delivery as a replay in the log.

**Q16 — Where does the IPv6 embedded-IPv4 SSRF gap get closed?** §9.2 documents that the
shared policy covers IPv4-mapped IPv6 but not NAT64, 6to4, or Teredo. It is a pre-existing
gap, not one this RFC creates, but webhooks are the first feature that lets any token
holder aim the server at any name. Options: fold it into PR 1 (the SSRF refactor, where it
is cheap and the tests are already being written), or file a separate hardening card so
that PR 1 stays a pure no-behavior-change refactor. *Recommendation:* PR 1 — a hardening
card filed alongside a feature that needs it tends not to happen before the feature.

**Q17 — Ratify the MCP parity deviation (§10.7)?** `CONTRIBUTING.md` requires every REST
operation to have a `mail_*` tool. v1 ships **five** tools (four as originally approved by D17,
plus `mail_webhook_disable` added by R71) and leaves **four** non-admin routes
(`GET /v1/webhooks/:id`, `POST /v1/webhooks/:id`, `POST …/rotate`, `GET …/secret`) REST-only, on the
argument that MCP tools are effectively permanent and an agent does not need to rotate
signing keys from inside its own loop. The owner may prefer strict parity — nine tools
from day one — since deviating from a stated CONTRIBUTING rule is a maintainer decision,
not an author's. Related and worth deciding at the same time: is `mail_webhook_create`
correctly tiered `critical` (deny-by-default for OAuth tickets), or is `contained` enough?
§10.7 argues `critical` because a webhook is a *persistent* egress target rather than a
one-shot outbound act like `mail_send`.

**Q18 — Should private webhook targets be governed by an operator host allowlist rather than
an admin-only rule?** §10.4 Rule C restricts private targets to admin keys when
`WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true`, which stops an identity token from aiming at the
internal network. An allowlist (`WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_PRIVATE_HOSTS`, CSV) would be strictly
stronger: the operator names the one or two internal services a callback may legitimately
reach, and everything else is refused even for admin. *Recommendation:* ship the admin-only
rule in v1 and add the allowlist only if an operator asks, since v1's escape hatch is off by
default and the admin key is already the highest-trust credential on the instance.

**Q19 — Should OAE enforce a minimum approval lifetime at creation?** §6.3 clamps
`expiresInSec` to a minimum of 0 and nulls it if the deadline has already passed, because
`assertApprovalExpiryBound()` only requires the deadline to be later than the moment
validation begins while `createApprovalTask()` writes durably before assigning `createdAt`
(`tasks-internal.ts:1550`). Clamping keeps the webhook honest but leaves an approval that can
be born effectively expired. Enforcing a minimum lifetime (say 60 s) at creation would fix the
root cause — but it changes task-API validation, which is outside this RFC's scope and would
affect callers who never use webhooks. *Recommendation:* clamp in v1 as specified, and file the
minimum-lifetime question against the task API separately.

**Q20 — Should `CreateApprovalTaskInput` gain a real `reviewer` field?** Today
`createApprovalTask()` hardcodes `reviewer: to` (`tasks-internal.ts:1535`) and the
reconstruction path rejects any snapshot where they differ (`:992`), so in v1 **the assignee
is always the reviewer** (§6.3). The consequence for #109's flagship human-in-the-loop case is
that an agent cannot route an approval to itself while paging a human — it must address the
approval *to* the human. Adding a distinct reviewer is a task-API change affecting the stamp,
the digest inputs, and the ACL checks at `:990-993`, so it is out of scope here. *Recommendation:*
leave v1 as-is; revisit if real deployments show agents wanting to keep assignment and paging
separate.

**Q21 — Extract embedded IPv4, or blanket-refuse the NAT64 / 6to4 / Teredo prefixes?** D16
ratified closing the gap in PR 1 but not *how*. Blanket refusal is simpler and blocks
`64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe` correctly, but on a DNS64 IPv6-only deployment it also blocks every
legitimate public IPv4 target, since all of them are synthesized into that prefix (§9.2).
Extraction is strictly better on both axes and costs more parsing in the one module `net.ts:1`
forbids duplicating. *Recommendation:* extraction, decided now so PR 1 is written once.

**Q22 — Should `MessageDetail` carry `uidValidity`?** It does not today (`imap.ts:58-74`),
which is why the cross-channel dedupe key in §11.5 cannot be generation-qualified and a
consumer using both webhooks and `mail_wait_for` can wrongly suppress a message after an INBOX
recreation. Small, independent of this feature, and it also strengthens `mail_wait_for` on its
own terms. *Recommendation:* yes, as a separate small card.

## 17. Decisions

Ratified **2026-09-03**. The owner decided four questions (D1, D2, D3, D4 below, answering
Q1, Q4, Q7, Q10); the commander approved the remaining thirteen at the values this document
recommended. Three decisions **overrode** a recommendation — D1 on the event catalog, D2 on
the retry budget, and D4 on the UI — and all three are recorded as overrides rather than
silently rewritten into the text, so a future reader can see what the design argued for and
what was chosen instead.

Each entry lists the sections it changed, because a decision that is not reflected in the
body of the document is not a decision.

### Owner decisions

**D1 — v1 catalog is `mail.received` *plus* `approval.requested`.** *(Answers Q1. Overrides
the recommendation to ship one event type first.)*

The human-in-the-loop approval push is in v1, not deferred. The owner explicitly accepted the
cost this document attached to it, and asked that one dependency be written down rather than
left implicit:

- **`approval.expired` moves to v1.1 and is blocked on a missing emitter, not on design
  work.** Expiry is materialized lazily when something next reads the task
  (`materializeApprovalExpiry()`, `tasks-internal.ts:1444`), and the source comment states
  there is no scheduler and no list sweep (`:1442`). A webhook cannot fire at a moment
  nothing observes, so `approval.expired` requires a **reaper** — new production machinery
  that would race the existing lazy path on the same task lock. Recorded in §2.2 and §5.2.
- **`approval.decided` stays reserved** even though `decideApprovalTask()`
  (`tasks-internal.ts:2440`) is a clean emitter; D1 scoped v1 to the two requested events.

Changed: §2.1 goal 1; §2.2 (approval non-goal rewritten, reaper dependency recorded); §5.1
(catalog table, two producers, per-type emission granularity); §5.2 (`approval.requested`
removed from reserved, `approval.decided` / `approval.expired` split out); **new §6.3**
(`approval.requested` payload schema, reviewer-based subscription matching, digest-verified
refetch); §6.6 (two new bounding constants); §10.1 (two new env vars); §10.3 (example
subscribes to both types); §11.4 **new item 4** (the dispatcher needs a second, non-IMAP
producer with weaker recovery semantics, and dispatch must be hand-off rather than await);
§14 (new test items); §15 (PR 2 re-scoped and re-rated **high**, PR 4 covers both types).

**D2 — retry budget extended to three days.** *(Answers Q4. Overrides the recommendation of
~27 hours.)*

Eleven attempts spanning exactly 72 h, aligning with Stripe and SendGrid rather than
Resend's shorter published schedule. The perishability objection this document raised is
answered by front-loading — four attempts inside 35 minutes — so urgent mail is unaffected by
the longer tail; the queue-cost objection is **not** answered and is carried forward as a
constraint on the durable log.

Changed: §4.2 (the three-day horizon moved from Refuse to Borrow, with the override
recorded); §4.4 (table); **§8.3 rewritten** (eleven cumulative offsets, switched from delays
to offsets because a 72 h budget makes delay arithmetic error-prone, and two consequences
documented); §8.5 (circuit-breaker unit, settled separately as D2a below); §8.6 (three-day
queue horizon, indexed reconstruction); §10.1 (`WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` default 11).

**D2a — circuit-breaker unit: consecutive failed *attempts*, reset on any success.**
*(A consequence of D2 rather than an answer to a numbered question. Ruled by the commander,
**overriding** this document's proposal to count exhausted events.)*

The counter is per endpoint, increments on each `retryable` or `permanent` attempt, ignores
`deferred`, resets to zero on any success, and disables at `WEBHOOK_DISABLE_THRESHOLD = 10`.
`refused` still disables immediately, without reaching the threshold.

The ruling's reasoning is better than the proposal it replaced: an event only *exhausts* after
its full 72-hour schedule, so a breaker that waited for exhaustion could not fire until two
days after the endpoint broke — at which point it is a post-mortem, not a breaker. This
document's original worry (that counting attempts would let two failing events disable a busy
but healthy endpoint) is answered by **reset-on-success** rather than by changing the unit: a
flaky endpoint that mostly works is never disabled, while a dead one trips as fast as evidence
accumulates. Threshold 10 follows the ordinary consecutive-failure convention; a
volume-plus-error-rate window would be meaningless at per-endpoint concurrency 1 (§8.7).

One property is documented rather than hidden (§8.5): because a single event's attempts are
spread across 72 hours, wall-clock trip time depends on mail volume — roughly +48 h for a
quiet mailbox with one dead event, minutes for a busy one.

Changed: §8.3 consequence 2; **§8.5 rewritten** (rule, which outcomes count, reset semantics,
rationale, volume dependence); §8.2 (`deferred` explicitly excluded); §10.1 (default 10 plus
semantics); §10.5 (`consecutiveFailures` persisted, and why it must survive restart); §13;
§14 item 3.

**D3 — multi-tenant hosted policy is recorded as "must answer before hosting", and v1 does
not lock the design.** *(Answers Q7.)*

The per-endpoint rate limits, subscription caps, and abuse surface all change shape on shared
infrastructure, and `OAE_PUBLIC_EDGE=true` becomes the norm rather than the exception. v1
ships the self-hosted design and does not pre-commit to hosted answers.

Changed: §16 Q7 retained as the standing blocker; no v1 design change. `WEBHOOK_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`
and the §8.7 caps are stated as self-hosted defaults, deliberately not as a hosted quota model.

**D4 — v1 ships a read-only dashboard panel; the "no new UI" non-goal is withdrawn.**
*(Answers Q10. Overrides the recommendation to defer UI.)*

A read-only view of subscriptions, deliveries, and dead letters under Configure, aligned with
the Configure section ADR-0026 already plans and mirroring the existing notification-log
view. Read-only is the whole scope: no create, edit, rotate, delete, enable, or redeliver from
a browser session, which keeps the cookie-session surface out of the secret-handling paths.

Changed: §2.1 **new goal 8**; §2.2 (the "no new UI" non-goal replaced by the narrower "no
*write* operations from the dashboard"); **new §10.8** (routes, contents, prohibitions,
inherited `/ui` constraints); §8.5 (state surfaced in the panel); §13 (health signal shares
one data source with the panel); §14 (new test item); §15 (**new PR 5**).

### Commander approvals at recommended values

| # | Answers | Decision | Sections it settles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **D5** | Q2 | `contentScope: preview` is **admin-only**. No identity-token self-escalation, even with an acknowledgement flag — a stolen identity token must gain convenience, never a content-exfiltration channel. | §6.5, §10.4, §12.4 |
| **D6** | Q3 | Signing key is **derived** (option B), never stored: `HMAC(root, "webhook-signing-v1\n" + webhookId + "\n" + epoch)`. No plaintext usable secret at rest, anywhere in the repo. The `epoch` is what makes per-endpoint rotation possible without rotating the root. Boot refuses the `SMTP_PASS` fallback when webhooks are enabled. | §10.2 item 1, §12.1, §12.2 |
| **D7** | Q5 | **Weak restart semantics accepted.** Pending retries are rebuilt from the delivery log; events emitted while the process was down are not reconstructed in v1. For the task producer this is a worse loss profile than for mail, and §11.4 item 4 records it rather than hiding it. | §8.6, §11.4 item 4 |
| **D8** | Q6 | **PR 2 is dispatched by the commander; ownership TBD.** It must not be started until an owner is named, since D1 raised its risk rating to high. | §11.4, §15 |
| **D9** | Q8 | **`mail_wait_for` cursor support gets its own card.** The asymmetry is real — long-polling rescans the newest 20 with no watermark while webhooks have one — but it is out of scope here. | §11.5, §16 Q8 |
| **D10** | Q9 | **Inbound webhooks are a split card.** Opposite trust direction, unrelated auth model, different abuse surface. | §2.2 |
| **D11** | Q11 | **Circuit-breaker recovery is manual only** (`POST /v1/webhooks/:id/enable`). No automatic probe. Silently resuming would hide a dropped window. | §8.5 |
| **D12** | Q12 | **Ping at creation is asynchronous**, and a third endpoint state `unverified` is added to the state machine until a delivery succeeds. The state is advisory — events still flow — and exists for operator feedback. | §5.1, §8.5 (new state machine), §10.3 (create response), §10.8 |
| **D13** | Q13 | **Signature encoding is lower-case hex**, deviating from the repo's base64url stamp convention. Recorded as a **one-way door**: once an integrator ships a verifier, changing the encoding requires a `v2=`. Event ids stay UUIDv4. | §7.2 |
| **D14** | Q14 | **Deferred with D3.** Per-identity subscription caps wait on the hosted answer. | §8.7, §16 Q14 |
| **D15** | Q15 | **Redelivery covers succeeded deliveries as well as dead letters**, admin-only, with `replay: true` marked in the log row. Follows Resend's "replay both `failed` and `succeeded`". **Its purpose is narrower than the first draft claimed** — see the correction below this table. | §8.6 (log row), §10.3, §10.8 |
| **D16** | Q16 | **The IPv6 embedded-IPv4 SSRF gap is closed in PR 1**, not deferred to a separate hardening card. NAT64, 6to4, and Teredo forms join the §9.2 always-refused list. | §9.2, §14 item 2, §15 PR 1 |
| **D17** | Q17 | **MCP tools approved** — as ratified: four (`mail_webhook_list`, `mail_webhook_create`, `mail_webhook_delete`, `mail_webhook_test`), with **`mail_webhook_create` at tier `critical`** so it is deny-by-default for OAuth tickets. **Amended by R71 to five**, adding `mail_webhook_disable` (`minimal`); the REST-only deviation list correspondingly grows from three routes to four, `GET …/secret` being deliberately excluded from the agent surface on blast-radius grounds (§10.7). | §10.4, §10.7, §14 item 7, §15 PR 4 |

**D15 correction.** This document originally justified replaying a *succeeded* delivery as "how
an integrator tests their handler against a real payload without waiting for real mail". That
contradicts §8.1, which normatively requires consumers to dedupe on the event `id` — and a
replay deliberately reuses the same `id` (§10.3). A **compliant** consumer therefore ignores
the replay, so it cannot be a handler-testing mechanism. What replaying a success is actually
for:

1. **Verifying the OAE side end-to-end** — that the endpoint is still reachable, still
   verifying signatures, and still returning 2xx — without waiting for new mail. The operator
   learns the outcome from the log and `lastDelivery`, which is the real deliverable.
2. **Re-driving a consumer that acknowledged but did not finish.** A handler that returned 200
   and then crashed before persisting has, from OAE's perspective, succeeded. Replay is the
   operator's tool for pushing it again; whether the consumer reprocesses is *its* dedupe
   policy's decision, and a consumer that wants to reprocess on replay must key on
   `X-OAE-Delivery` (per attempt) rather than `id` (per event) — which is exactly why §7.1 keeps
   the two identifiers distinct.
3. **Not** for making a correctly-deduping consumer run its handler twice. An integrator who
   wants that should point a *second, throwaway* subscription at a test endpoint instead, which
   is cheaper and does not involve lying to a production consumer.

§10.3's wording ("leans on their `id` dedupe") and this entry now agree; previously they did
not.

### Still open after ratification

Two items are deliberately **not** settled, and should not be read as decided:

1. **D3 / D14** — everything about multi-tenant hosted operation, blocked until hosting is
   actually planned.
2. **The approval reaper** — prerequisite for `approval.expired` (v1.1) and, if the owner
   decides a lost `approval.requested` is unacceptable, also the fix for the task producer's
   weak restart semantics (§11.4 item 4). Both should be designed together.

Everything else is settled, including **D2a**, which the commander ruled on after the first
ratification pass: the circuit breaker counts consecutive failed attempts, per endpoint, reset
on any success, threshold 10 (§8.5). Two further questions were *opened* by the review fixes
rather than closed — **Q18** (private-host allowlist) and **Q19** (minimum approval lifetime)
— and remain for the owner.

### Post-ratification amendments from independent review

After ratification, two independent review gates read the document against the source and
found **eleven defects**, all in normative text. None changes a ratified *decision*; all
change the specification of one. They are recorded here rather than folded in silently,
because they amend text the commander approved and a reviewer comparing against the ratified
version needs to know what moved.

| # | Defect | Severity | Fixed in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Boot rule only required an explicit `TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` when `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` was unset — but `data.cursor` is a **second** known-plaintext MAC keyed on `taskSigningSecret`, so the `SMTP_PASS` fallback leaked an offline-cracking oracle to every consumer regardless. Contradicted §12.1's own unconditional statement. | **P1 security** | §10.2 item 1 (now unconditional, with the cursor path explained) |
| R2 | The `critical` MCP tier does **not** gate a direct REST call: `bearerAuth` collapses an OAuth token to identity scope, so `POST /v1/webhooks` would have granted the persistent egress capability the tier exists to withhold. | **P1 security** | §10.4 (route must consult `TokenAttribution`), §10.3 (new 403) |
| R3 | Boot reconstruction selected *every* row with a future `nextAttemptAt`, so after two failures a restart enqueued one retry per past failure, violating per-endpoint concurrency and burning the budget repeatedly. | P1 | §8.6 (latest-row-per-pair algorithm) |
| R4 | Boot reconstruction filtered on `nextAttemptAt > now`, so any outage spanning a scheduled attempt **silently truncated** the remaining 72-hour sequence. | P1 | §8.6 (step 4, `max(nextAttemptAt, bootTime)`) |
| R5 | §12.2 step 1 said rotation "rotates the root" — which would invalidate every other endpoint, contradicting the per-endpoint epoch design in §12.1. | P1 | §12.2 step 1 |
| R6 | `webhooks.json` omitted `epoch` and `overlapUntil`, so a rotated endpoint could not re-derive its key after restart and would silently revert. | P1 | §10.5 |
| R7 | "Rotation must be idempotent" was an instruction with no mechanism; a client retrying after a timeout was indistinguishable from an intentional second rotation. | P1 | §12.2 (`Idempotency-Key` contract) |
| R8 | §6.6's overflow drop order and never-dropped set were mail-only, leaving `approval.requested` — added by D1 — with no degradation path, so a 4 KiB `actionArguments` could fail delivery outright. | P1 | §6.6 (per-type orders) |
| R9 | §8.6 said "re-fetch by `messageId`" but IMAP has no lookup-by-UUID; the id **is** a UID and stops being addressable when `UIDVALIDITY` changes. | P2 | §8.6 (`uidValidity` recorded, `uidvalidity_changed` dead-letter, header-search fallback) |
| R10 | §12.5 named a separate `/test` rate limit as "the obvious mitigation" but §8.7 never specified one, leaving the egress-probing residual unmitigated. | P2 | §8.7 + §10.1 (`WEBHOOK_RATE_TEST_PER_MIN`), §12.5 narrowed |
| R11 | `POST /v1/webhooks/:id` could change `url` without re-running static validation, letting a forbidden URL persist until delivery time. | P2 | §10.3 |

Two follow-ons were resolved rather than left open, because R1 and D6 made them answerable:
the admin secret re-display route is now specified (§12.3, §10.3, audited as
`webhook.reveal`), and §13's state list carries all three states from D12.

**A second review round on the ratified commit found twenty-two more defects**, including one
outright factual error about existing code and five security holes, and the commander's final
review then caught **six more** (R34–R39, all P2 wording and contract gaps). Twenty-eight in
total. They are recorded here on the same terms: none changes a ratified decision, all change
the specification of one.

| # | Defect | Severity | Fixed in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R12 | **The cursor paginates backwards.** `listMessagesPageWith()` filters with `isAfterCursor()`, selecting *older* mail (`imap.ts:632-636`, `:786-790`). The RFC's entire "push to wake, pull to read" catch-up path was built on passing the last delivered cursor back — which returns older mail and omits everything that arrived during the outage. | **P1 factual** | §3.7, §8.4, §15 PR 3 (re-scoped and re-rated medium) |
| R13 | Told consumers to sort by `data.cursor`, but a `mail-cursor-v1` value is base64url JSON plus an HMAC and is **not** lexicographically sortable — it produces a wrong order that looks plausible. | P1 | §6.2 (new `uid` / `uidValidity`), §8.4, Appendix A |
| R14 | Examples showed `messageId` as a UUID, but OAE message ids are decimal IMAP UIDs (`toDetail()` emits `String(uid)`), so the normative example would 404 against `GET /v1/messages/:id`. | P1 | §6.2, §6.4, §8.6 |
| R15 | **Identity token could redirect an admin's `preview` subscription** by changing only `url`, silently defeating the admin-only preview rule and opening a content-exfiltration channel. | **P1 security** | §10.4 Rule B |
| R16 | OAuth exclusion covered only create and rotate; `bearerAuth` collapses OAuth to identity scope, so an OAuth token could still update a subscription or trigger probes via `test`. | **P1 security** | §10.4 Rule A |
| R17 | With `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true`, every identity token could target RFC1918 / loopback / CGNAT / ULA — an internal-network oracle. | **P1 security** | §10.4 Rule C, §10.1 |
| R18 | Delivery-time revalidation of an `http` target only reapplied the SSRF policy, under which **public** addresses are valid — a host private at creation could later resolve publicly and OAE would send metadata over plaintext internet HTTP. | **P1 security** | §9.3 step 5 |
| R19 | The shared transport's timeout is Node's **inactivity-based** `req.setTimeout()` (`oauth-cimd.ts:474-476`), so a slowloris endpoint dribbling bytes could hold a delivery slot for hours and pin the whole instance pool. | **P1 security** | §9.7, §15 PR 1 |
| R20 | Creation-triggered pings were not charged to the probe bucket, so delete-and-recreate at the 10/min create rate yielded 10+ probes/min with observable feedback — bounding only `/test` bounded nothing. | P1 | §8.7, §9.7, §12.5 |
| R21 | Deleting an identity left its subscriptions behind; recreating the address resumed the old callback, a durable exfiltration channel outliving its credential. | P1 | §10.5 |
| R22 | Full jitter on every gap made the published 72 h horizon an upper bound rather than a promise, quietly weakening the outage coverage D2 bought. | P1 | §8.3 |
| R23 | OAE's own rate-limit denial was unclassified; charging it as a failure would let a busy mailbox disable its own healthy endpoint. | P1 | §8.2 (new `deferred` outcome) |
| R24 | No durable record existed for a queued-but-unattempted event, so a saturated pool lost events precisely under burst load. | P1 | §8.6 (`pending` outcome) |
| R25 | Reconstruction grouped by `(webhookId, eventId)`, collapsing manual replays into the original run and discarding a replay's pending retry in favour of an older success. | P1 | §8.6 (`runId`) |
| R26 | Root-secret rotation claimed an overlap it could not deliver: after restart only the new root exists, so `epoch - 1` derives a key nobody ever used. | P1 | §12.2, §10.1 (`WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET_PREVIOUS`) |
| R27 | Derived keys are 32 raw bytes but examples showed a `whs_`-prefixed hex string, and the producer/consumer could each pick a different one — failing every delivery with no diagnostic. | P1 | §12.1 (normative encoding), Appendix A |
| R28 | `data.from` was never-dropped *and* uncapped, so an oversized attacker-controlled display name could push a payload over the cap and suppress its own webhook. | P2 | §6.6 |
| R29 | `actionArguments` was typed `object`, but the task API allows any JSON value, making existing approvals unrepresentable. | P2 | §6.3 |
| R30 | `expiresInSec` was asserted always positive, but the durable write precedes `createdAt` assignment, so it can round to 0 or go negative. | P2 | §6.3, §16 Q19 |
| R31 | `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES=0` under the repo's `0 = disabled` convention meant an unlimited response read — the exact amplification §9.7 prevents. | P2 | §8.7, §10.1 |
| R32 | `description` was accepted by the create contract but dropped from storage and response. | P2 | §10.3, §10.5 |
| R33 | `/ui/api/webhooks/summary` listed after `/:id`, which Hono would match as `id = "summary"`. | P2 | §10.8 |
| R34 | §7.1 hardcoded `X-OAE-Event: mail.received`, but D1 added two more emitted types. | P2 | §7.1 (value is now the event type, byte-identical to the body's `type`) |
| R35 | An `active` boolean existed in the update route and storage with **no defined semantics** anywhere, overlapping §8.5's three-value `state`. | P2 | §10.3, §10.5, §8.5 (field removed; pause expressed as `state: disabled` + `disabledReason: manual`, with a new `/disable` route) |
| R36 | D15 justified replaying a success as a handler-testing mechanism, contradicting §8.1's mandatory dedupe on `id` — a compliant consumer ignores the replay. | P2 | §17 D15 correction, §10.3 |
| R37 | The audit whitelist has no field identifying *which* subscription was mutated, and §8.7 allows four per address. | P2 | §10.6 (adds optional `webhookId`) |
| R38 | `POST /:id/test` promised `{deliveryId, outcome, status}` unconditionally, but DNS failure, connection refused, TLS error, and timeout have no HTTP status. | P2 | §10.3 (`status` nullable, new `reason` field) |
| R39 | The creation ping can reach the consumer **before** the operator has the secret from the `201`, so it fails verification; the mitigations were implicit and undocumented. | P2 | §5.1 (ordering stated; ping failures excluded from the breaker) |

R12 is the one that matters most, and it is worth being blunt about: it was a **factual error
about existing code**, in the section the first draft introduced as "the single most useful
existing primitive for webhooks" (that phrasing is gone now, and deserved to be). The entire
catch-up story rested on it. It survived the first review round because that round checked
whether the cursor *existed* and was signed, not which direction it traversed. §3.7 now states
the direction explicitly and §15 PR 3 is re-scoped from a thin route change to new IMAP query
semantics.

**A third round — the commander's second final review against head `d86cc3a` plus local source
verification — found twenty-two more**, including a second factual error about existing code
and a security hole introduced by the previous round's own fix. Recorded as R40–R61.

| # | Defect | Severity | Fixed in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R40 | **Second factual error about existing code.** The RFC called the UID watermark "durable-ish" and said restart behavior "depends on watermark durability". It is **in-memory only**: `notification-watcher.ts:138` says so, `runWatcher()` recreates it empty (`:1555`), and first sight anchors to the high-water UID and **emits nothing** (`:216-218`). Events during downtime are *guaranteed* lost. | **P1 factual** | §8.6, §11.4 intro, §11.4 item 4 |
| R41 | **`reviewer` is always exactly `to`.** `createApprovalTask()` hardcodes `reviewer: to` (`tasks-internal.ts:1535`), `CreateApprovalTaskInput` has no reviewer field (`:257-266`), and `:992` rejects any snapshot where they differ. The RFC treated them as distinct parties, the §6.4 example used two different addresses (an impossible state), and §14 required a test asserting they differ — implementing it literally would have suppressed **every** approval webhook. | **P1 factual** | §6.3, §6.4, §5.1, §12.4, §14 item 9, §16 Q20 |
| R42 | Rule B blocked `update(url)` and `DELETE` but not `rotate`, so an identity token could rotate an admin's `preview` subscription and be handed a fresh signing key for a scope it may not set — plus a denial of service on the admin's consumer. | **P1 security** | §10.4 Rule B |
| R43 | **R35's own fix opened a hole:** the new `/disable` route was not in Rule A's OAuth list. Separately, §14 item 7 required `mail_webhook_test` to be *permitted* for OAuth while Rule A forbade the identical REST operation — an OAuth bypass through the MCP door. | **P1 security** | §10.4 Rule A (now "every mutation", not an enumeration), §14 item 7 |
| R44 | Rule C judged privacy only against the **creation-time** resolution. An identity could create while the host resolved publicly, then rebind DNS inward; §9.1's delivery-time rule consults only the *global* escape hatch and so would wave it through. | **P1 security** | §10.4 Rule C, §10.5 (`privateTargetGranted`), §14 item 2 |
| R45 | §8.6 said approvals re-fetch "by task id" but the log row had **no `taskId` field**, so pending approval events were unreconstructable after restart — losing exactly the human-paging event D1 added. | P1 | §8.6 (row + per-type population) |
| R46 | Reconstruction step 3 discarded any group with `attempt >= MAX` and a non-success outcome. Since the `pending` row is written *before* the attempt, a crash there lost the eleventh attempt — the one §8.3 pins to +72 h — with no dead-letter row to show it. | P1 | §8.6 step 3 (`pending` is never final) |
| R47 | `sensitive: true` rows "wrote nothing beyond" four fields, dropping `webhookId`, `runId`, `attempt`, `nextAttemptAt` — so **every pending `preview` delivery was silently lost at restart**. | P1 | §8.6 (`sensitive` is a marker, not a reducer; explicit minimum reconstructable set) |
| R48 | Admin-only secret re-display plus an idempotent-replay rule returning `secret: null` left an **identity** caller who lost a `rotate` response with no way ever to recover its own key. | P1 | §12.3 (re-display follows Rule B), §10.3 |
| R49 | A second rotation inside the 24 h overlap window advanced to `epoch+1` and signed `(epoch+1, epoch)`, **immediately dropping `epoch-1`** — the overlap guarantee silently stopped being one. | P1 | §12.2 (`409 rotation_window_open`, explicit `force`) |
| R50 | `deferred` rescheduling took the **earlier** of `retryAfterSec` and the next offset, which hot-loops when the offset is already past. | P2 | §8.2 (`max()`, with the reasoning) |
| R51 | The D2a ruling's interaction with D2 was unstated: threshold 10 against 11 attempts means a quiet mailbox trips at +48 h and attempt 11 never runs, which reads as contradicting §8.3's pinned horizon. | P2 | §8.5 (interaction paragraph; neither decision changed) |
| R52 | §10.3's `DELETE` did not say it cancels queued retries, while §10.5's identity cascade did. | P2 | §10.3 (`subscription_deleted` dead-letter reason) |
| R53 | `WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` had no upper bound, but §8.3 defines exactly eleven offsets. | P2 | §10.1 (bounded 1–11) |
| R54 | The proposed forward cursor did not bind `uidValidity`; after an INBOX recreation a stale cursor would silently select *different* messages sharing a UID. | P2 | §3.7 (bind and reject on mismatch) |
| R55 | `WEBHOOK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` allowed ≥ 1 day, so compaction could delete the only durable record of a pending attempt **before it was due**, dropping attempts 9–11. | P2 | §8.6, §10.1 (floor 4, tied to the horizon) |
| R56 | D16's blanket refusal of `64:ff9b::/96` also blocks every legitimate IPv4 target on a **DNS64 IPv6-only** deployment. The cost was unrecorded. | P2 | §9.2 (cost recorded, extraction alternative named), §16 Q21 |
| R57 | `expiresInSec` was typed `integer` in the table while the prose allowed `0`/`null` and §14 asserted "always positive" — three-way disagreement. | P2 | §6.3 (`integer \| null`), §14 item 9 |
| R58 | The cross-channel dedupe key included `uidValidity`, which **cannot be constructed** from a `mail_wait_for` response — `MessageDetail` (`imap.ts:58-74`) has no such field. | P2 | §11.5 (key corrected, limitation and bounded-window mitigation documented), §16 Q22 |
| R59 | `GET /:id/secret` returns long-lived key material with no cache directive. | P2 | §10.3 (`Cache-Control: no-store`, no `ETag`) |
| R60 | Create was non-idempotent: losing the `201` lost the secret permanently, and the natural retry consumed another per-address slot, so two lost responses could exhaust the cap with orphans. | P2 | §10.3 (`Idempotency-Key` on create), §12.3 |
| R61 | `webhook.ping`'s `data` shape was never defined, though §6.1 requires a `data` object with a discriminator. | P2 | §5.1 (`{object, webhookId, trigger}`, with the reason `address` is excluded) |

R43 deserves particular note: it was introduced **by the previous round's fix** for R35.
Adding a route without adding it to the authorization rule that enumerates routes is exactly
the failure mode Rule A now avoids by being stated as "every mutation" rather than as a list.
R40 and R41 are the second and third factual errors about existing code in this document's
history (after R12's cursor direction), and both were caught only by reading source rather
than by reasoning about the design — which is the argument for §14's verification list being
as long as it is.

**Running total: 61 recorded defects across four review passes** (R1–R11 pre-ratification,
R12–R33 and R34–R39 post-ratification, R40–R61 final). Three were factual errors about
existing code (R12 cursor direction, R40 watermark durability, R41 reviewer identity) and
eight were security holes in the design itself (R1, R2, R15–R20, R42–R44). That ratio is the
reason this document keeps a per-defect record instead of silently converging: a design doc
that has been wrong about its own codebase three times should not ask a reader to trust the
parts nobody has checked yet.

**A fourth round — the commander's third final review, the last before merge — found thirteen
more** (2 P1, 11 P2), recorded as R62–R74. Anything raised after this point goes to
implementation PR cards rather than back into this document.

| # | Defect | Severity | Fixed in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R62 | **Introduced by R48's own fix.** Re-display was scoped by *address* plus `contentScope`, so an identity token could re-display the live signing key of a `metadata` subscription an **admin** created for its address. Combined with the `url` it can already read from the detail route, that is enough to **forge deliveries the consumer verifies as authentic** — confidentiality scoping does not protect integrity. | **P1 security** | §10.4 **new Rule D** (creator-scoped), §12.3, §10.3, §12.4, §14 item 7 |
| R63 | **Refetch does not validate the mailbox generation.** `getMessageWith()` checks only that the id is a positive integer (`imap.ts:898-909`) and `lib/imap.ts` never mentions `uidValidity`. With a 72-hour delivery horizon, an INBOX rebuilt mid-window reassigns UIDs, so the documented refetch returns a *different* message with a `200` and no signal — an agent acts on the wrong mail. | **P1 security** | §6.2 (warning + required `uidValidity` precondition, `404 stale_message_generation`), §15 PR 3 |
| R64 | `POST /:id/test` against a `disabled` endpoint was undefined: §8.5 suppresses all delivery while disabled, but the route promised to fire a ping and await the first attempt. | P2 | §10.3 (`409 webhook_disabled`, plus the `/test`-without-`/enable` asymmetry documented) |
| R65 | The overflow spec covered most but not all fields — `sizeBytes`, `hasAttachments`, `unread` were in neither the drop order nor the never-dropped set. | P2 | §6.6 (all three never-dropped; every §6.2 field now accounted for) |
| R66 | Reconstruction on a `UIDVALIDITY` mismatch said both "dead-letter unconditionally" and "a Message-ID fallback may be used" — not a specification. | P2 | §8.6 (ordered and total: match → fetch by UID; mismatch → header search; absent, zero, or ambiguous match → dead-letter; unique match → rebuild with fresh `uid`/`uidValidity`/`cursor`, preserved `eventId`) |
| R67 | Claimed `WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS=8` restores the original ~27 h budget. Under the cumulative-offset table attempt 8 is at **+20 h**; the ~27 h figure came from summing the old inter-attempt delays. | P2 | §8.3, §10.1 |
| R68 | The event bus's IMAP fetch was never specified, and the existing one (`notification-watcher.ts:1457-1461`, `envelope` + `delivered-to` + `source`) lacks **`flags`** — so `unread` cannot be populated — and lacks **`internalDate`**, the only non-forgeable source for `receivedAt`. Using the envelope `Date:` would order on sender-controlled data. | P2 | §11.4 item 2 (mandatory fetch widening) |
| R69 | Pool-saturation `deferred` had no reschedule delay, because `retryAfterSec` exists only for the rate limiter. | P2 | §8.2 (per-cause table, new `WEBHOOK_POOL_RETRY_MS`), §10.1 |
| R70 | Auditing every delivery attempt would rotate `audit.jsonl` past its 10 MiB + single `.1` budget in hours at configured ceilings (~960 rows/min), evicting the authentication and administration history the log exists to keep. | P2 | §10.6 (`webhook.deliver` not audited; attempts live only in the delivery log) |
| R71 | The MCP parity table omitted `/disable` and `GET /:id/secret`, both identity-reachable. | P2 | §10.7 (adds `mail_webhook_disable` at `minimal`; secret re-display deliberately REST-only on blast-radius grounds — **this raises the tool count from D17's four to five**, flagged as a change to a ratified decision) |
| R72 | Security tests were phased into PR 6 while the changes they guard landed in PR 1 (SSRF policy) and PR 4 (signing) — so both would merge unguarded, and a guard added later can only reject a change already landed. | P2 | §15 (each test moved into the PR it protects; PR 6 reduced to docs and packaging) |
| R73 | The probe budget counted only triggers, so the stated "3 probes/min" was really **~9 connections/min** once each ping's three attempts are included. | P2 | §8.7, §9.7, §12.5 (honest ceiling stated; retries deliberately not charged to the caller's bucket, with the reasoning) |
| R74 | `links` were truncated at `WEBHOOK_CODE_ENTRY_CHARS`, which corrupts signed verification URLs — and the repo already settled this: `packPushLinkLines()` is documented as *"Never mid-truncates a URL; drops the tail"* (`notification-watcher.ts:266-268`). | P2 | §6.2, §6.6 (over-long links dropped whole; `containsLink` stays `true`) |

R62 and R63 are the two that matter most, and they are different kinds of failure. R62 is a
**regression introduced by a fix** — the second time in this document's history (after R43),
and both times the cause was the same: adding or widening a capability without re-reading the
authorization rule that governs it. Rule D is now stated as a principle ("authorization is a
function of the subscription's stored state *and its creator*") rather than a route list, for
the same reason Rule A was restated that way. R63 is a **cross-section gap**: §4.2 borrowed
Stripe's refetch pattern, §6.2 added `uidValidity` to the payload, and §8.3 extended the
delivery horizon to 72 hours — each reasonable alone, and together they made the refetch path
unsafe, because nothing connected the horizon to the fact that `imap.ts` has no generation
check. No single section was wrong; the composition was.

**Running total after this round: 74 recorded defects across five review passes** (R1–R74).
Four were factual errors about existing code (R12, R40, R41, R63) and eleven were security
holes in the design itself (R1, R2, R15–R20, R42–R44, R62, R63). Two were regressions
introduced by the previous round's own fixes (R43, R62).

**D2a has since been ruled on** (§17): consecutive failed attempts, per endpoint, reset on any
success, threshold 10 — overriding this document's exhausted-events proposal. The review fixes
above make that ruling *more* effective, not less: R3, R4 and R25 mean an endpoint now
genuinely exercises its retry schedule instead of losing or duplicating attempts, so the
attempt counter reflects real evidence rather than reconstruction artifacts.

## Appendix A: normative signature summary

For an implementer who reads nothing else:

```
Header:  X-OAE-Signature: t=<unix-seconds>,v1=<lower-case-hex>[,v1=<lower-case-hex>]
Signed:  "<t>" + "." + <exact UTF-8 bytes of the request body as transmitted>
Mac:     HMAC-SHA256
Key:     the UTF-8 bytes of the endpoint secret STRING as displayed, i.e. "whs_" + 64
         lower-case hex chars (§12.1). Not the 32 raw digest bytes.
Accept:  if ANY v1 value matches AND abs(now - t) <= 300 s. Ignore keys you do not
         understand (v2=, …); reject only when no SUPPORTED signature matches.
Reject:  otherwise, always, with no unsigned fallback
Dedupe:  on the body's "id" field; deliveries are at-least-once
Order:   not guaranteed; sort by data.receivedAt then data.uid within one
         data.uidValidity. data.cursor is OPAQUE — never sort or string-compare it
Fetch:   full mail content via GET /v1/messages/:id?uidValidity=<data.uidValidity> with your own API token
```

## Appendix B: relationship to other cards

| Card | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| #109 | This RFC is the design record #109 asks for, **ratified 2026-09-03** (§17). D1 pulled `approval.requested` into v1, so #109's human-in-the-loop unlock ships alongside the postmaster-agent one rather than after it. |
| #105 | Refused in core (§2.2). Webhooks are the substrate for a userland responder; the RFC argues a core LLM responder inherits prompt injection from every inbound body. |
| #59 | Not implemented. §7.6 keeps the signature header shape so an asymmetric `v2=` scheme is additive. Nothing else here commits to federation. |
| #72 | Compliance auto-BCC already shipped (`9209aee`). #109 notes it becomes a userland "subscribe an archiver endpoint" pattern; §12.1 reuses its `TASK_SIGNING_SECRET` boot rule. |
| ADR-0026 | Supplies the Configure-section plan and the notification-log view idiom that §10.8's read-only panel deliberately mirrors (D4 made that panel a v1 deliverable), the single-data-source rule §13 reuses so the panel and health counts cannot disagree, and the fact that tasks are authoritatively IMAP mail threads — relevant to any future `task.*` event source. |
